I powered down the dishwasher at the circuit breaker and then reached under the dishwasher and pulled away the 2 wires that were attached to each side of the heater element.

Very easy.}', '{Installation Issue: Missing 2 rollers in lower basket, How to Repair: Alighned the bracket and pushed in.}', '{Installation Issue: spray arm fell off and melted on element, How to Repair: The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element.  This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around.  The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support.  All told, about 10 minutes, max.}', '{Installation Issue: Appliance read out ""err"", would not go on, How to Repair: It would sometimes work, which led me to believe it was a switch.

It was very simple to change the switch.}', ""{Installation Issue: No water to dish washer, How to Repair: After figuring out the problem wasn't the water inlet switch, I replaced the switch assembly for the water level float.

Piece of cake!}', '{Installation Issue: Spray arm came off in wash cycle, How to Repair: The spray arm comes off into 3 parts but is really only supposed to be one.  I removed the nut from the old assembly and attempted to place the new assembly on by hand.  The new nut seemed to be slightly smaller than the original so it would not attach to the dishwasher.  Using a kitchen knife, I removed the new nut from the arm unit and attached the new arm to the original nut and it went back on easily.  The connection of the new arm to the new nut was 3 tabs that needed to be depressed with the knife and was a different conection method than the assembly that kept coming off in the wash cycle.  The replacement part had a much better design than the original.}', '{Installation Issue: large holes in the bottom of the basket where pieces of plastic kept breaking off, How to Repair: I replaced the basket.

Remove the foot plates, remove the two top screws holding the dishwasher.  Then using the socket  set, retract the two foot stands to pull the dishwasher forward.  You may not have to do this step as I had to get it over tile.  The pully springs are on the sides, easily replaced.  After replacing the springs and I recommend replacing both at the same time, put everything back.  The hardest part will be the foot plates, there are two and getting them lined up and the screws back in is a bit of a challenge.

Water drip could be seen coming from the motor area. Ordered the O rings and replaced. Get Motor & Pump schematic Pub   to visualize how parts fit together. I recommend getting motor (~$90)which comes with O rings (~$50 for O rings alone) because, as it turns out, the leak was in motor.

I had a little (very little) trouble figuring out how to fit the gasket. It didn't go on like i thought it should. There was no gasket on the original fixture. So I put it on the way I thought it should go. I then screwed the new Arm-Control fixture on to the outlet. That was it.

The part I need is like a bellows of sorts that fits on the water line attached to the upper shelf. The part received goes on the back wall. Now i am back at square one with part I don't need and hoping for the part I do need}"", '{Installation Issue: Portions of the rack had the coating wear off, exposing the metal, which began to rust., How to Repair: Removing the old rack was accomplished by removing the grey retainer clips located at the end of the silver rack guides. This allows the entire upper rack to slide out of the guide tracks. Unless you purchased all of the additional parts associated with the rack you must remove the needed old parts such as the spray arm, plate guides, wheel assemblies, etc. to complete the replacement and reassembly. Each of these pieces are ""snapped on"" by clips that are removed with moderate difficulty. Mostly due to the apprehension that you are going to break them, however, with only the pressure exerted by your fingers they will snap off and will go actually go back on easier. The order you remove and replace the various parts is your choice. The exact positioning of the parts back on the new rack is critical, so if your memory is not good, take a quick photo with your cell phone for reference. The only tool I used was a small screwdriver to separate the clip when I first removed the rack, but in retrospect I could have removed it by hand. The key thing to remember is do not apply excess force when trying to remove the old parts, just direct  pressure with your fingers. Good luck, it took me only about 15 minutes from start to finish. The best part is I probably saved $150.00 by doing it myself, figuring service time for a repairman, plus his mark-up on the parts.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher Leakibng, How to Repair: Removed the bottom covering on dishwasher and then ran it to figure out where the leak was coming from.

Noticed gasket was partially depleted.Ordered new gasket, replaced and put everything back together. (Be sure to use teflon tape on water source fitting and tighten firmly).  No leaks}', '{Installation Issue: Broke nubs off of stem when cleaning, How to Repair: I took the bottom parts out. This can basically be done without tools. You need a phillips to unscrew 3 screws to remove the stem. Then easily replace with the new one. Putting the spiny washing part was kinda weird because I was afraid to break the nubs off again. I took the whole bottom carriage out so I could see better, pushed down kinda hard and twisted the right way (figure out which way needs to be twisted before hand by looking through the bottom of the stem).}', ""{Installation Issue: Dishwasher was leaking out of small gold nut, How to Repair: The nut was split down one side, so I first tried to sauder the nut back together.  Saudering never goes well for me anyway, but I couldn't get a good enough seal around the nut to make it fit tightly.  Then I had to cut off the clear plastic shield to get down in there, just before realizing you could just pull the white wire firmly and it would come loose from the nut.  All I had to do then was unscrew the original nut, and screw on the new nut.  Then, luckily I had mistakenly ordered an extra clear plastic shield and could replace the one I had previously cut.  Dishwasher now runs like a charm!}"", '{Installation Issue: Upper spray arm fell/broke off, How to Repair: I researched the problem we had with our dishwasher and found the Parts Select website.

Turn dishwasher upright. Be careful with placement of new gasket when reinserting sump so that the gasket doesn't come out of position and the sump is centered properly. Secure with retaining nuts from bottom. Reconnect power connector and hoses to sump. Pour enough water into the dishwasher to verify gasket doesn't leak... look with flashlight under dishwasher for signs of water dripping from sump. Reinstall screen and centerpiece in sump inside the dishwasher. Reconnect water line and power cord. Run through wash cycle while monitoring for leaks under dishwasher. Reinstall wire trays.

And this was the easiest project I’ve tackled as a homeowner since buying the place 20 years ago.  I read the other stories and I think the suggestion I choose to follow is not the best thing to do.  So, read passed where I cut the gasket. I used needle nose pliers to grab the bottom edge of the old gasket which then pulled out by hand with almost no effort.  I used the old gasket to measure the new gasket as recommended in one of the other stories, and cut it.  DON""T DO THIS.  The gasket is very soft foam rubber.  As you push it in (I just used my fingers), it will get longer as you push it in.  I put it in the first time (took about a minute if that long) and even though I cut it to the same length as the old one, it was too long.  Obviously I figured I did something wrong.  So, I took it out and measured it again.  Nope, same-same.  So, I put in a second time, careful not to stretch it, and this time it was now too short. So, I recommend that you just establish the bottom edge 90 degree angle seat and try not to stretch it as you work your way around the seam.  It should fit just find, maybe with a little adjustment back or forth, but without cutting it at all.  By the way, the half inch I cut off at the recommendation of one of the other reviews did not ruin it.  It works just fine. So you can cut it if you want I suppose. But that half inch I cut off was what I was short when I was carful not to stretch it.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher was leaking caused by a cracked brass nut attaching to the heating element., How to Repair: First I removed the two screws that hold the dishwasher in place, I pulled out the dishwasher and on the bottom right located the leak. The two brass nuts that hold the heating element in place. The wires had been rusted to the element so I cut the wires (and later spliced them back together) and unscrewed the brass nuts.

I removed the nut from the old assembly and attempted to place the new assembly on by hand.  The new nut seemed to be slightly smaller than the original so it would not attach to the dishwasher.  Using a kitchen knife, I removed the new nut from the arm unit and attached the new arm to the original nut and it went back on easily.  The connection of the new arm to the new nut was 3 tabs that needed to be depressed with the knife and was a different conection method than the assembly that kept coming off in the wash cycle.

You may not have to do this step as I had to get it over tile.  The pully springs are on the sides, easily replaced.

Now i am back at square one with part I don't need and hoping for the part I do need}"", '{Installation Issue: Portions of the rack had the coating wear off, exposing the metal, which began to rust., How to Repair: Removing the old rack was accomplished by removing the grey retainer clips located at the end of the silver rack guides. This allows the entire upper rack to slide out of the guide tracks. Unless you purchased all of the additional parts associated with the rack you must remove the needed old parts such as the spray arm, plate guides, wheel assemblies, etc. to complete the replacement and reassembly. Each of these pieces are ""snapped on"" by clips that are removed with moderate difficulty. Mostly due to the apprehension that you are going to break them, however, with only the pressure exerted by your fingers they will snap off and will go actually go back on easier. The order you remove and replace the various parts is your choice. The exact positioning of the parts back on the new rack is critical, so if your memory is not good, take a quick photo with your cell phone for reference. The only tool I used was a small screwdriver to separate the clip when I first removed the rack, but in retrospect I could have removed it by hand. The key thing to remember is do not apply excess force when trying to remove the old parts, just direct  pressure with your fingers. Good luck, it took me only about 15 minutes from start to finish. The best part is I probably saved $150.00 by doing it myself, figuring service time for a repairman, plus his mark-up on the parts.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher Leakibng, How to Repair: Removed the bottom covering on dishwasher and then ran it to figure out where the leak was coming from.

Noticed gasket was partially depleted.Ordered new gasket, replaced and put everything back together. (Be sure to use teflon tape on water source fitting and tighten firmly).  No leaks}', '{Installation Issue: Broke nubs off of stem when cleaning, How to Repair: I took the bottom parts out. This can basically be done without tools. You need a phillips to unscrew 3 screws to remove the stem. Then easily replace with the new one. Putting the spiny washing part was kinda weird because I was afraid to break the nubs off again. I took the whole bottom carriage out so I could see better, pushed down kinda hard and twisted the right way (figure out which way needs to be twisted before hand by looking through the bottom of the stem).}', ""{Installation Issue: Dishwasher was leaking out of small gold nut, How to Repair: The nut was split down one side, so I first tried to sauder the nut back together.  Saudering never goes well for me anyway, but I couldn't get a good enough seal around the nut to make it fit tightly.  Then I had to cut off the clear plastic shield to get down in there, just before realizing you could just pull the white wire firmly and it would come loose from the nut.  All I had to do then was unscrew the original nut, and screw on the new nut.  Then, luckily I had mistakenly ordered an extra clear plastic shield and could replace the one I had previously cut.

And this was the easiest project I’ve tackled as a homeowner since buying the place 20 years ago.  I read the other stories and I think the suggestion I choose to follow is not the best thing to do.  So, read passed where I cut the gasket. I used needle nose pliers to grab the bottom edge of the old gasket which then pulled out by hand with almost no effort.  I used the old gasket to measure the new gasket as recommended in one of the other stories, and cut it.  DON""T DO THIS.  The gasket is very soft foam rubber.  As you push it in (I just used my fingers), it will get longer as you push it in.  I put it in the first time (took about a minute if that long) and even though I cut it to the same length as the old one, it was too long.  Obviously I figured I did something wrong.  So, I took it out and measured it again.  Nope, same-same.  So, I put in a second time, careful not to stretch it, and this time it was now too short. So, I recommend that you just establish the bottom edge 90 degree angle seat and try not to stretch it as you work your way around the seam.  It should fit just find, maybe with a little adjustment back or forth, but without cutting it at all.  By the way, the half inch I cut off at the recommendation of one of the other reviews did not ruin it.  It works just fine. So you can cut it if you want I suppose. But that half inch I cut off was what I was short when I was carful not to stretch it.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher was leaking caused by a cracked brass nut attaching to the heating element., How to Repair: First I removed the two screws that hold the dishwasher in place, I pulled out the dishwasher and on the bottom right located the leak.

Discard impeller and O-ring, but keep blade (I couldn’t find the O-ring; it had probably disintegrated).- Remove pump housing, pump plate, and gasket.- Use two flat-head screwdrivers on opposite sides of the rotor to pry it off the motor shaft.  Be cautious not to damage the area around the motor shaft—wood can be used to protect the area and provide better leverage.  If the rotor can’t be removed, a chisel or hacksaw can be used to split it before prying it up— be cautious of the motor shaft when splitting the rotor.  Discard the rotor.  - Locate the upper seal, note its orientation (cup-side-down), remove it, and discard it (my upper seal was in the recess in the bottom of the rotor).-Drive the shaft-key (small metal tab) out of the shaft groove using a hammer and flat-head screwdriver and discard it— the new rotor has a molded-in tab that will slide into the groove in place of the shaft-key.- Remove ceramic ring from motor shaft and discard it (my leak was caused because the ceramic ring was broken in half).- Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry loose the lower seal—before removing it from the shaft, note its orientation (wide-side-down).  Be caution not to damage the area around the motor shaft—wood may again be used for protection and leverage.CLEANING/PREP- Clean shaft with wire brush, white vinegar, and a rag (you may not need the wire brush if the shaft is in good shape, but my motor shaft was heavily corroded/rusted and I needed to smooth it to prevent it damaging the seals).  Clean groove in motor shaft with flat-head screwdriver and rag.- Use a rag and white vinegar to clean motor shaft recess and pump housing seat.  The bottom of the motor shaft recess must be clean and smooth for the lower seal to seat properly.- Clean pump plate, gasket, blade, pump housing, and screws with white vinegar and a plastic-bristled brush.ASSEMBLY-Wet new rubber seals, new ceramic ring, and new rotor with water to help them slide into place.-Refer to pics taken during disassembly as needed for the following steps.- Place new lower seal (wide-side-down) over motor shaft in bottom of recess.-Push new upper seal (cup-side-down) into recessed area in the bottom of the new rotor.-Push new ceramic ring into upper seal (cup-side) in bottom of rotor.-Align groove on motor shaft with tab in rotor (a mark on the outside of the rotor shows the tab’s location) and seat rotor on the motor shaft by hand.  Verify that the motor turns when the rotor is turned by hand.   If not, remove the rotor and reposition it so that its tab slides into the groove in the motor shaft.-Place gasket, pump plate, and pump housing in position.  Start pump housing screws, but leave them loose.- Place blade and new O-ring on rotor.- Place new impeller on rotor and insert screw.  Tighten moderately — overtightening could cause leaks.  Hold the impeller by hand to prevent it turning as the screw is tightened— do not use a screwdriver to prevent the impeller turning.- Finish tightening pump housing screws.- Seat spray-arm base on pump housing and insert/tighten its mounting screws.- Switch on circuit breaker for dishwasher. - Start washer and watch motor to verify that shaft seal is not leaking.  Run a full cycle to rinse the new parts and remove debris and vinegar residue.

When I was finished, there was about an inch between the two ends at the bottom where the gasket wasn't quite long enough for them to meet. I was a bit concerned seeing the basin fills with water.

I also filled in the gap at the bottom with a small section of the old gasket, as suggested by (other) installers. Why not? Anyways, it took both hands to close the door the first 3-4 washes. Easy to open/close now. AND... no more leaks! Great price, too!}', ""{Installation Issue: Dishwasher door spring broke, letting the door fly down too fast, How to Repair: I removed some philips screws from the kick plate along the bottom of the dishwasher.  I then removed some trim screws on the sides of the bottom door panel (the smaller panel below the door on the front of the dishwasher).  There were also two screws into the top of the lower panel that you can only see when the door is open.  This let me remove the whole lower door panel and kick plate.  It was now possible to see the springs on the left and right, and it is actually possible to change them at this point, just with access through the front.  However, it is very awkward.  Contrary to what some repairs have said, it really is much easier if you can pull the dishwasher out from under the counter about 6 inches.  To do that, you'll have to unbolt it, and that will vary depending on how yours was mounted.  You may find brackets along the front, screws or bolts through the frame into the floor, and/or retaining straps from the top up to the counter.Beyond that, it's simple.  You'll see that the spring hooks into a slot  or hole on a large L-shaped bracket that moves with the door.  There is one on each side at the bottom of the door.  The other end of each spring hooks through a hole in the frame rail on the bottom.  There will likely be several holes, letting you choose how tight you want the spring (this controls how easily the door will drop).A pair of needlenose pliers is handy for getting the spring end into the holes.Again, it was a lot easier doing this from the outside of the dishwasher after pulling it out a few inches.}"", '{Installation Issue: Our dishwasher flooded the floor!, How to Repair: I called an appliance store and they said to bring in the model number and a deposit and they would order it for us.

After moving in and using the dishwasher twice, it developed a major leak coming from the bottom of the unit. ""Here goes more money that I don\'t have, to hire an appliance repairman to fix this leak!"" I decided to take the bottom kick panel off the dishwasher to see where the leak was coming from. It was coming from the the connection of the heater element at the bottom of the dishwasher. I found a brass nut had been cracked and wouldn\'t stay tight any more. I ordered the replacement nut from Partselect, RECEIVED IT THE NEXT DAY!!!!! using regular ground shipping, and installed the new nut using a socket set, and tested the unit. No more leaks!! Partselect saved me at least $150.00 on a service call for a $3.50 part. I\'m not the handiest guy around, but even this was easy!I also scored big points with the wife on my handyman repair! Thanks Partselect!Greg}', ""{Installation Issue: Dishwasher door spring broke, letting the door fly down too fast, How to Repair: I removed some philips screws from the kick plate along the bottom of the dishwasher.  I then removed some trim screws on the sides of the bottom door panel (the smaller panel below the door on the front of the dishwasher).  There were also two screws into the top of the lower panel that you can only see when the door is open.  This let me remove the whole lower door panel and kick plate.  It was now possible to see the springs on the left and right, and it is actually possible to change them at this point, just with access through the front.  However, it is very awkward.  Contrary to what some repairs have said, it really is much easier if you can pull the dishwasher out from under the counter about 6 inches.  To do that, you'll have to unbolt it, and that will vary depending on how yours was mounted.  You may find brackets along the front, screws or bolts through the frame into the floor, and/or retaining straps from the top up to the counter.Beyond that, it's simple.  You'll see that the spring hooks into a slot  or hole on a large L-shaped bracket that moves with the door.  There is one on each side at the bottom of the door.  The other end of each spring hooks through a hole in the frame rail on the bottom.  There will likely be several holes, letting you choose how tight you want the spring (this controls how easily the door will drop).A pair of needlenose pliers is handy for getting the spring end into the holes.Again, it was a lot easier doing this from the outside of the dishwasher after pulling it out a few inches.}"", '{Installation Issue: Our dishwasher flooded the floor!, How to Repair: I called an appliance store and they said to bring in the model number and a deposit and they would order it for us.

We put it back in and washed dishes the old-fashioned way for another 3 months after that. I asked at my local hardware store for the part, and thought about trying one of those big-box do-it-yourself stores but never got around to it.

The dishwasher unit was checked out to be in fine shape. Before moving in, I had all the hardwood floors refinished, including the kitchen, and everything looked great. After moving in and using the dishwasher twice, it developed a major leak coming from the bottom of the unit. ""Here goes more money that I don\'t have, to hire an appliance repairman to fix this leak!"" I decided to take the bottom kick panel off the dishwasher to see where the leak was coming from. It was coming from the the connection of the heater element at the bottom of the dishwasher. I found a brass nut had been cracked and wouldn\'t stay tight any more. I ordered the replacement nut from Partselect, RECEIVED IT THE NEXT DAY!!!!! using regular ground shipping, and installed the new nut using a socket set, and tested the unit. No more leaks!! Partselect saved me at least $150.00 on a service call for a $3.50 part. I\'m not the handiest guy around, but even this was easy!I also scored big points with the wife on my handyman repair! Thanks Partselect!Greg}', ""{Installation Issue: Dishwasher door spring broke, letting the door fly down too fast, How to Repair: I removed some philips screws from the kick plate along the bottom of the dishwasher.  I then removed some trim screws on the sides of the bottom door panel (the smaller panel below the door on the front of the dishwasher).  There were also two screws into the top of the lower panel that you can only see when the door is open.  This let me remove the whole lower door panel and kick plate.  It was now possible to see the springs on the left and right, and it is actually possible to change them at this point, just with access through the front.  However, it is very awkward.  Contrary to what some repairs have said, it really is much easier if you can pull the dishwasher out from under the counter about 6 inches.  To do that, you'll have to unbolt it, and that will vary depending on how yours was mounted.  You may find brackets along the front, screws or bolts through the frame into the floor, and/or retaining straps from the top up to the counter.Beyond that, it's simple.  You'll see that the spring hooks into a slot  or hole on a large L-shaped bracket that moves with the door.  There is one on each side at the bottom of the door.  The other end of each spring hooks through a hole in the frame rail on the bottom.  There will likely be several holes, letting you choose how tight you want the spring (this controls how easily the door will drop).A pair of needlenose pliers is handy for getting the spring end into the holes.Again, it was a lot easier doing this from the outside of the dishwasher after pulling it out a few inches.}"", '{Installation Issue: Water was leaking through the heating element Accra point., How to Repair: Isolated the leak and found the nut had split thereby allowing a loose seal and water penetration.

I then removed some trim screws on the sides of the bottom door panel (the smaller panel below the door on the front of the dishwasher).  There were also two screws into the top of the lower panel that you can only see when the door is open.  This let me remove the whole lower door panel and kick plate.  It was now possible to see the springs on the left and right, and it is actually possible to change them at this point, just with access through the front.  However, it is very awkward.  Contrary to what some repairs have said, it really is much easier if you can pull the dishwasher out from under the counter about 6 inches.  To do that, you'll have to unbolt it, and that will vary depending on how yours was mounted.  You may find brackets along the front, screws or bolts through the frame into the floor, and/or retaining straps from the top up to the counter.Beyond that, it's simple.  You'll see that the spring hooks into a slot  or hole on a large L-shaped bracket that moves with the door.  There is one on each side at the bottom of the door.  The other end of each spring hooks through a hole in the frame rail on the bottom.  There will likely be several holes, letting you choose how tight you want the spring (this controls how easily the door will drop).A pair of needlenose pliers is handy for getting the spring end into the holes.Again, it was a lot easier doing this from the outside of the dishwasher after pulling it out a few inches.}"", '{Installation Issue: Our dishwasher flooded the floor!, How to Repair: I called an appliance store and they said to bring in the model number and a deposit and they would order it for us.

I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered.

I had previously removed the front bottom cover plates (4 screws). I opened the front, removed the lower dish rack and unscrewed it from the bottom side of the counter, disconnected the water supply and drain line, then wiggled it out being careful of the insulation sheets, hoses, etc.  Note, water drains everywhere.  I had some baking pans to contain and paper towels to wipe but still, be safe / prepared.I disconnected everything from the motor / impeller housing area, then went inside the unit and loosened the lock ring thing around the base of whatever you call the spinning arm / sprayer, it took a little effort, might be easier to try this when it is still mounted to the counter.  After that main ring was removed the housing with the motor and everything just wiggled free.I unscrewed the motor\'s 3 Torx screws, and then the unscrewed the plastic ""X"" at the end opposite the motor, the brass weight pulls straight off and the impeller is supposed to come off too.  Mine was stuck like many I read about.  I drilled a hole in the end of the plastic impeller and drove the motor shaft out with a punch and hammer, it worked pretty slick.  Then I carefully pried out the last seal and stopped for a cold beverage, major success.I carefully pushed the new seal into the housing, reattached the motor to the housing, pushed on the other new seals, the impeller, the new brass weight in the same order the old ones were, and screwed on the ""X"" on the end as snug as I could.  Then I carefully reattached the motor and housing to the bottom of the dishwasher, ensuring good solid seals and tightening that big ring again from the inside as snug as I could get it, carefully hooked everything on the bottom back up basically in the reverse of disassembly, put the unit back under the counter, plugged it in, turned the water back on to it, loaded it and tested it.  I was fortunate enough to not have it leak anywhere, after 3 or 4 loads I reattached the bottom trim pieces and checked this off my list.Also, would love to mention that your site is great, the parts were priced attractively, they arrived very quickly and were a snap to install.Thanks for saving me a ton of money / headaches!Andy}', ""{Installation Issue: Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel, How to Repair: The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'.

First I looked it up on the internet. All kind of results, except for the model I was working on. Called, very nice woman directed me to yet another YouTube presentation for another model. As this was no help, I chose to not call her back. Not her fault.So, I did what every instruction for the other models called for, disconnect the power. Seemed like a good idea if everyone suggested it. After that, remove the inner door by removing the screws. At this point I would like to mention that I also ordered and paid for what I thought would be a set of inner door screws to replace the old and weathered ones. However, they sent me one screw.Who in their right mind would pay $5.10 for ONE SCREW? Well, your looking right at him. I felt like I sold the family cow for a magic bean, but that’s another story. So, without instructions, I compared the part I ordered with the one installed in the door. It matched up in many ways, with exception for the fact I would not budge from it’s position, wiggle yes, remove no. I stared at it for 10 minutes with no further progress. Something has to give. I decided to remove the cover of the electronics with the hopes and optimism of a child. It also did not want to be removed. Back to YouTube and the computer. Nothing. I stared at it for another 10 minutes. Drank a beer, and started to “horse” it off, somehow it became ajar, and was finally removed. Upon examination of the old door latch bolt, I noticed that it was attached to the electronic mass by 4 wires. I used my phone camera to record which went where with false hopes that the repair was in reach. It was either me or the dishwasher. At this point, good money was on the dishwasher.After recording and removal of said wires, I took the entire door latch and whatever the other piece was, to a table for further study, and another beer. After said study and beer, I remembered looking at other parts, one came to mind, a small teflon rod. As I look upon the part I knew about, I noticed it was adhering to the alien part with wires by 2 small teflon rods. I found a small nail, and pushed them out of the part, and they final separated. I replaced the old part with the new one and then  reversed all steps and procedures, attached wires, reattached electronic cover, screwed down the inner door, shut main door, and started a dish cycle. Works perfectly. You may ask about the expensive screw. I took it to a local jeweler, who found nothing remarkable about it. As there must be SOMETHING about it that makes it valuable, so I had it mounted and framed in a nice display case for friends and family to treasure for years to come. A real conversation piece, and one more thing to dust.}', '{Installation Issue: Water remaining at end of cycle, How to Repair: Forum was not too helpful diagonsing problem.Decided to take apart to clean and found all blades broke off impeller.Use shop vac to suck out water.Remove agitator inside unit.Remove dishwasher from wall tip down on door.Remove pump.unscrew housing to find impellor.Carefully put on new impeller.Clean sealing sufaces, Reinstall.Some broken impeller blades were found in agitator.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher stopped in middle of wash cycle.., How to Repair: I disasembled the inner door and replaced the door switches with new ones.}', '{Installation Issue: door insert all scatched up, How to Repair: Took me a while to figure out that the bottom plastic strip is all that holds in the panel.

So you need a special screwdriver or I had a socket set of them and I used a ratchet to make it easier. I think there are nine of them around the base of the door. Then remove the door and set it on the counter. Flip it over and there is a small plastic cover that has to be removed from the back of it, and it is easily removed by gently pulling on it. Now comes the difficult part. There is a locking piece on it that holds the latch onto the door by interlocking with a piece on the back side of the door.  I took a pair of wire snips and just cut the old interlocking piece off. This way I didn't have to try and slide the two interlocking pieces apart.  When you go to put the new piece on before you interlock them make sure they are put on right. Specifically the latch is pointing the right way to seal the detergent door. Otherwise it can be a pain to separate the interlocking pieces again. (which is why I cut it off the old one).  Then you're done. Just put it all back together.}"", '{Installation Issue: Detergent Cup does not open, How to Repair: Disconnect power supply to dishwasher. Open door and remove screws on inner door cover.

After much cocnsternation I turned the water supply valve to the dishwasher a partial turn to close and I felt the water rush through the valve and the dishwasher then filled.

I removed the seal seat ring and using the impeller and seal kit I replaced all the internal parts to the impeller system.

It was leaking from just above tne door front panel, directly underneath the control panel buttons. I opened the dishwasher door, and decided to remove the door screen vent.  I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered.

First I looked it up on the internet. All kind of results, except for the model I was working on. Called, very nice woman directed me to yet another YouTube presentation for another model. As this was no help, I chose to not call her back. Not her fault.So, I did what every instruction for the other models called for, disconnect the power. Seemed like a good idea if everyone suggested it. After that, remove the inner door by removing the screws. At this point I would like to mention that I also ordered and paid for what I thought would be a set of inner door screws to replace the old and weathered ones. However, they sent me one screw.Who in their right mind would pay $5.10 for ONE SCREW? Well, your looking right at him. I felt like I sold the family cow for a magic bean, but that’s another story. So, without instructions, I compared the part I ordered with the one installed in the door. It matched up in many ways, with exception for the fact I would not budge from it’s position, wiggle yes, remove no. I stared at it for 10 minutes with no further progress. Something has to give. I decided to remove the cover of the electronics with the hopes and optimism of a child. It also did not want to be removed. Back to YouTube and the computer. Nothing. I stared at it for another 10 minutes. Drank a beer, and started to “horse” it off, somehow it became ajar, and was finally removed. Upon examination of the old door latch bolt, I noticed that it was attached to the electronic mass by 4 wires. I used my phone camera to record which went where with false hopes that the repair was in reach. It was either me or the dishwasher. At this point, good money was on the dishwasher.After recording and removal of said wires, I took the entire door latch and whatever the other piece was, to a table for further study, and another beer. After said study and beer, I remembered looking at other parts, one came to mind, a small teflon rod. As I look upon the part I knew about, I noticed it was adhering to the alien part with wires by 2 small teflon rods. I found a small nail, and pushed them out of the part, and they final separated. I replaced the old part with the new one and then  reversed all steps and procedures, attached wires, reattached electronic cover, screwed down the inner door, shut main door, and started a dish cycle. Works perfectly. You may ask about the expensive screw. I took it to a local jeweler, who found nothing remarkable about it. As there must be SOMETHING about it that makes it valuable, so I had it mounted and framed in a nice display case for friends and family to treasure for years to come.

As others have stated this is a new design but directly replaceable and easy to do.This didn't solve the cleaning issue so reading the experiences of others on this site realized I also had broken parts in the Upper Spray Arm Assembly and the Upper Wash assembly. I replaced these and the dishes were suddenly much, much cleaner. These were very easily replaced.I did find that I did not need the Mount for the upper spray arm (PS402277) as a redesign of the Upper Spray Arm Mounting bracket no longer required it - the bracket simply clipped in -the diagram was out of date. Everything seemed to go well for about 3 loads when the dishwasher started leaking heavily out of the bottom of the door. I then noticed that the lower Wash Arm Bearing Ring and the Seal, Lower Spray Arm had disintegrated so I replaced those but this didn't affect the leaking. Someone had stated that if the lower wash arm assembly had too much 'wobble' that it cause 'waves' that would leak out the front door... mine had some wobble so I added a nylon washer from Ace Hardware that reduced wobble but still leaked.I then replaced the Door Seal Kit - this was by far the most difficult part as the door needed to be removed and it was somewhat difficult - and it seemed apparent after we had removed the door that these parts weren't the problem but we replaced them anyway. Also, someone else had noted that they had to attach the door seal (this is NOT the gasket that goes around the door opening) with a sealant - I had the same problem; the original seal fit tightly with friction but the new replacement required an adhesive - I used silicone. Still leaked.From here on I can't guaratee any useful information: I took the strainer screen out of the bottom of the dishwasher and found one slightly loose screw holding what I believe is the 'pump outlet' according to the diagram. I had also read that the water fill is controlled not by the float at the bottom of the washer but by the electronics and it was suggested that I disconnect the DW from the power to 'reset' the timer, this I did and hit the 'Cancel' cycle a couple of times to make sure that all programs were cancelled. Whether any of this made a difference I have no idea - except that the dishwasher suddenly stopped leaking and hasn't leaked a drop for at least 20 washes. So I don't know, for sure, why it leaked or how I fixed it, but it's working and washing great now - except the tines on the lower rack are beginning to rust out and breaking off. The rack is pretty expensive but so far I've saved a lot of money and my family thinks I'm a dishwasher genius.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Dishes not rinsing well, particles left on dishes, How to Repair: As others have described, this replacement was very easy.

This is the disk with swirl pattern on the back face., How to Repair: 1) Removed the two white clips from the left and righ hand side of the top tray roller rail.  this allows the tray to be completely removed and ease access to the washer assembly.   The clipe looks like the letter ""k"", so you will need to close the ""k"" to almost straight line in order to get it through the hole.2) Put a sheet or a towel at the bottom of the machine, just incase you drop the two small cross head screws.  This prevents the screws from falling to the bottom of the machine.3) Remove the screws.  At this time the washer assembly will/should slip out very easily. very little force is required to pull the assmbely out.4) Slip on the new washer assembly and put the screws back in place.  Tighten screws,  Be careful not over tighten the screw as you may crack the plastic flange.  Note:  My machine is an older model, so the washer assembly had two screw fixing.  The new assembly only had one hole.

It was leaking from just above tne door front panel, directly underneath the control panel buttons. I opened the dishwasher door, and decided to remove the door screen vent.  I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered.

But the arm would not spin freely.  It would bind against the bottom of the upper tray. Finally after about 20 minutes I noticed that the mount was slightly slanted to one side. This was not immediately apparent unless you look carefully. Further I noticed that the bottom of the upper tray was protruding lower on the right side. Finally I realized why the mount was slanted to one side.  I removed the mount and turned it 180 deg.. Bingo all fits and works perfectly.

First I looked it up on the internet. All kind of results, except for the model I was working on. Called, very nice woman directed me to yet another YouTube presentation for another model. As this was no help, I chose to not call her back. Not her fault.So, I did what every instruction for the other models called for, disconnect the power. Seemed like a good idea if everyone suggested it. After that, remove the inner door by removing the screws. At this point I would like to mention that I also ordered and paid for what I thought would be a set of inner door screws to replace the old and weathered ones. However, they sent me one screw.Who in their right mind would pay $5.10 for ONE SCREW? Well, your looking right at him. I felt like I sold the family cow for a magic bean, but that’s another story. So, without instructions, I compared the part I ordered with the one installed in the door. It matched up in many ways, with exception for the fact I would not budge from it’s position, wiggle yes, remove no. I stared at it for 10 minutes with no further progress. Something has to give. I decided to remove the cover of the electronics with the hopes and optimism of a child. It also did not want to be removed. Back to YouTube and the computer. Nothing. I stared at it for another 10 minutes. Drank a beer, and started to “horse” it off, somehow it became ajar, and was finally removed. Upon examination of the old door latch bolt, I noticed that it was attached to the electronic mass by 4 wires. I used my phone camera to record which went where with false hopes that the repair was in reach. It was either me or the dishwasher. At this point, good money was on the dishwasher.After recording and removal of said wires, I took the entire door latch and whatever the other piece was, to a table for further study, and another beer. After said study and beer, I remembered looking at other parts, one came to mind, a small teflon rod. As I look upon the part I knew about, I noticed it was adhering to the alien part with wires by 2 small teflon rods. I found a small nail, and pushed them out of the part, and they final separated. I replaced the old part with the new one and then  reversed all steps and procedures, attached wires, reattached electronic cover, screwed down the inner door, shut main door, and started a dish cycle. Works perfectly. You may ask about the expensive screw. I took it to a local jeweler, who found nothing remarkable about it.

As others have stated this is a new design but directly replaceable and easy to do.This didn't solve the cleaning issue so reading the experiences of others on this site realized I also had broken parts in the Upper Spray Arm Assembly and the Upper Wash assembly. I replaced these and the dishes were suddenly much, much cleaner. These were very easily replaced.I did find that I did not need the Mount for the upper spray arm (PS402277) as a redesign of the Upper Spray Arm Mounting bracket no longer required it - the bracket simply clipped in -the diagram was out of date. Everything seemed to go well for about 3 loads when the dishwasher started leaking heavily out of the bottom of the door. I then noticed that the lower Wash Arm Bearing Ring and the Seal, Lower Spray Arm had disintegrated so I replaced those but this didn't affect the leaking. Someone had stated that if the lower wash arm assembly had too much 'wobble' that it cause 'waves' that would leak out the front door... mine had some wobble so I added a nylon washer from Ace Hardware that reduced wobble but still leaked.I then replaced the Door Seal Kit - this was by far the most difficult part as the door needed to be removed and it was somewhat difficult - and it seemed apparent after we had removed the door that these parts weren't the problem but we replaced them anyway. Also, someone else had noted that they had to attach the door seal (this is NOT the gasket that goes around the door opening) with a sealant - I had the same problem; the original seal fit tightly with friction but the new replacement required an adhesive - I used silicone. Still leaked.From here on I can't guaratee any useful information: I took the strainer screen out of the bottom of the dishwasher and found one slightly loose screw holding what I believe is the 'pump outlet' according to the diagram. I had also read that the water fill is controlled not by the float at the bottom of the washer but by the electronics and it was suggested that I disconnect the DW from the power to 'reset' the timer, this I did and hit the 'Cancel' cycle a couple of times to make sure that all programs were cancelled. Whether any of this made a difference I have no idea - except that the dishwasher suddenly stopped leaking and hasn't leaked a drop for at least 20 washes. So I don't know, for sure, why it leaked or how I fixed it, but it's working and washing great now - except the tines on the lower rack are beginning to rust out and breaking off. The rack is pretty expensive but so far I've saved a lot of money and my family thinks I'm a dishwasher genius.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Dishes not rinsing well, particles left on dishes, How to Repair: As others have described, this replacement was very easy.

Using the kit I purchased I installed the new parts as required and it works as good as new.The whole problem started with the upper vent on the door being plugged up with a whole bunch of labels that had been washed off of a bunch of tin cans that were washed prior to recycling them.

Found plastic impeller worn through into two pieces & little spring thingy under the grinder-upper thingy broken.  Ordered Drain & Wash Impeller kit - got it a few days later - installed (new motor shaft seal didn't seem to be quite the same as far as fit, so I didn't use it - just used the impeller & new spring thingy)  Put it all back together & runs fine - no more leaks - (now just have to figure out what to do about warped wood flooring - oh well, it's old & is probably time for whole new kitchen floor anyway)  Note:  This particular Kenmore model made by Whirlpool - takes Whirlpool parts.Note 2:  Needed only screwdrivers to do this whole thing - would have been a really quick/easy repair if I had known what the problem was & how it all comes apart.   took a little time to figure it out.

So you need a special screwdriver or I had a socket set of them and I used a ratchet to make it easier. I think there are nine of them around the base of the door. Then remove the door and set it on the counter. Flip it over and there is a small plastic cover that has to be removed from the back of it, and it is easily removed by gently pulling on it. Now comes the difficult part. There is a locking piece on it that holds the latch onto the door by interlocking with a piece on the back side of the door.  I took a pair of wire snips and just cut the old interlocking piece off. This way I didn't have to try and slide the two interlocking pieces apart.  When you go to put the new piece on before you interlock them make sure they are put on right. Specifically the latch is pointing the right way to seal the detergent door. Otherwise it can be a pain to separate the interlocking pieces again. (which is why I cut it off the old one).  Then you're done. Just put it all back together.}"", '{Installation Issue: Detergent Cup does not open, How to Repair: Disconnect power supply to dishwasher. Open door and remove screws on inner door cover.

I removed the wires attached to the switch on the door handle and the door handle itself.  The handle and switch parts disassembled and I replaced the switches (part of kit).

I attached the new wires to the switches and closed up the interior door.  Lastly, I turned the circuit breaker back on.  All was well!}', '{Installation Issue: Water dripped out from the bottom of door., How to Repair: Diagnosing the problem, i.e. finding the source of the leak, was the hardest part. The best clue was the leak only occurred well into the cycle when the water was hot and steam was coming out the vent. I then assumed there was a bad seal and steam & condensed water was leaking down into the door. I replaced the vent duct & seal, a broken drip cover (an internal part in the door), and replaced a missing rinse aid cap. This stopped the leak.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher would not fill with water., How to Repair: After doing some research in a repair book I decided to take  a stab with a water inlet valve. With expedited shipping I ordered the part and within three days it was delivered. I installed it and the dishwasher seemed like it was trying to fill but still would not. After much cocnsternation I turned the water supply valve to the dishwasher a partial turn to close and I felt the water rush through the valve and the dishwasher then filled. Apparently the shut off valve must have been clogged plus it now leaked. I then replaced the shutoff valve and the copper pipe to the water inlet valve with flexible 3/8"" tubing and the dishwasher thus far is running fine without leaks.}', '{Installation Issue: Upper nozzle ""spinner"" had degraded to the point where it no longer worked, How to Repair: The only difficult part was taking out (relatively easy) and returning (hard) the clips from the rails.

There was only a metal ring and it was supposed to have a spring attached to it. I replaced the ring/spring below the wash impeller using the part from the Drain and Wash impeller kit.

I looked at the diagram on the website of the assembly, and also remembered what the assembly looked like before I took it apart.

This is the disk with swirl pattern on the back face., How to Repair: 1) Removed the two white clips from the left and righ hand side of the top tray roller rail.  this allows the tray to be completely removed and ease access to the washer assembly.   The clipe looks like the letter ""k"", so you will need to close the ""k"" to almost straight line in order to get it through the hole.2) Put a sheet or a towel at the bottom of the machine, just incase you drop the two small cross head screws.  This prevents the screws from falling to the bottom of the machine.3) Remove the screws.  At this time the washer assembly will/should slip out very easily. very little force is required to pull the assmbely out.4) Slip on the new washer assembly and put the screws back in place.  Tighten screws,  Be careful not over tighten the screw as you may crack the plastic flange.  Note:  My machine is an older model, so the washer assembly had two screw fixing.  The new assembly only had one hole.

It was leaking from just above tne door front panel, directly underneath the control panel buttons. I opened the dishwasher door, and decided to remove the door screen vent.  I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered.

There are two small rubber pieces located in mounting slots below the door gasket that slide out; I slide the old ones out and slide the new ones in.

That is an amazing service. When it arrived I noticed that the new part was re-designed but the dimensions appeared to be identical. Initially it was difficult to snap it in to position but with help of a screw driver it finally snapped in place. After re-installation of the upper wash arm all looked perfect.  But the arm would not spin freely.  It would bind against the bottom of the upper tray. Finally after about 20 minutes I noticed that the mount was slightly slanted to one side. This was not immediately apparent unless you look carefully. Further I noticed that the bottom of the upper tray was protruding lower on the right side. Finally I realized why the mount was slanted to one side.  I removed the mount and turned it 180 deg.. Bingo all fits and works perfectly. I could have avoided the problems if an orientation directions were included with the mount. I suspect that a less technical individual would likely not figure it out.}', '{Installation Issue: Top Water Tube hose broken., How to Repair: The part came so fast without extra shipping.

You will need to recycle two rubber bumpers, your old utensil basket and the cone in the center of the rack. Getting the cone free was not easy. It has to be rotated to release it from the wire rack. I had to pry it free with a screwdriver. Once rotated it lifted out easily. I noted how the cone lined up in the old rack and installed it the same way in the new rack. It was much easier to install than remove.

I cleaned around the housing, replaced the gasket and the missing screw.You need a Torx T-15 for this repair.

First I looked it up on the internet. All kind of results, except for the model I was working on. Called, very nice woman directed me to yet another YouTube presentation for another model. As this was no help, I chose to not call her back. Not her fault.So, I did what every instruction for the other models called for, disconnect the power. Seemed like a good idea if everyone suggested it. After that, remove the inner door by removing the screws. At this point I would like to mention that I also ordered and paid for what I thought would be a set of inner door screws to replace the old and weathered ones. However, they sent me one screw.Who in their right mind would pay $5.10 for ONE SCREW? Well, your looking right at him. I felt like I sold the family cow for a magic bean, but that’s another story. So, without instructions, I compared the part I ordered with the one installed in the door. It matched up in many ways, with exception for the fact I would not budge from it’s position, wiggle yes, remove no. I stared at it for 10 minutes with no further progress. Something has to give. I decided to remove the cover of the electronics with the hopes and optimism of a child. It also did not want to be removed. Back to YouTube and the computer. Nothing. I stared at it for another 10 minutes. Drank a beer, and started to “horse” it off, somehow it became ajar, and was finally removed. Upon examination of the old door latch bolt, I noticed that it was attached to the electronic mass by 4 wires. I used my phone camera to record which went where with false hopes that the repair was in reach. It was either me or the dishwasher. At this point, good money was on the dishwasher.After recording and removal of said wires, I took the entire door latch and whatever the other piece was, to a table for further study, and another beer. After said study and beer, I remembered looking at other parts, one came to mind, a small teflon rod. As I look upon the part I knew about, I noticed it was adhering to the alien part with wires by 2 small teflon rods. I found a small nail, and pushed them out of the part, and they final separated. I replaced the old part with the new one and then  reversed all steps and procedures, attached wires, reattached electronic cover, screwed down the inner door, shut main door, and started a dish cycle. Works perfectly. You may ask about the expensive screw. I took it to a local jeweler, who found nothing remarkable about it. As there must be SOMETHING about it that makes it valuable, so I had it mounted and framed in a nice display case for friends and family to treasure for years to come. A real conversation piece, and one more thing to dust.}', '{Installation Issue: Glasses and dishes had cooked on film on them due to no upper spinner rinse., How to Repair: Need needle nose pliers to remove the keepers in the end stops on basket rails.

As others have stated this is a new design but directly replaceable and easy to do.This didn't solve the cleaning issue so reading the experiences of others on this site realized I also had broken parts in the Upper Spray Arm Assembly and the Upper Wash assembly. I replaced these and the dishes were suddenly much, much cleaner. These were very easily replaced.I did find that I did not need the Mount for the upper spray arm (PS402277) as a redesign of the Upper Spray Arm Mounting bracket no longer required it - the bracket simply clipped in -the diagram was out of date. Everything seemed to go well for about 3 loads when the dishwasher started leaking heavily out of the bottom of the door. I then noticed that the lower Wash Arm Bearing Ring and the Seal, Lower Spray Arm had disintegrated so I replaced those but this didn't affect the leaking. Someone had stated that if the lower wash arm assembly had too much 'wobble' that it cause 'waves' that would leak out the front door... mine had some wobble so I added a nylon washer from Ace Hardware that reduced wobble but still leaked.I then replaced the Door Seal Kit - this was by far the most difficult part as the door needed to be removed and it was somewhat difficult - and it seemed apparent after we had removed the door that these parts weren't the problem but we replaced them anyway. Also, someone else had noted that they had to attach the door seal (this is NOT the gasket that goes around the door opening) with a sealant - I had the same problem; the original seal fit tightly with friction but the new replacement required an adhesive - I used silicone. Still leaked.From here on I can't guaratee any useful information: I took the strainer screen out of the bottom of the dishwasher and found one slightly loose screw holding what I believe is the 'pump outlet' according to the diagram. I had also read that the water fill is controlled not by the float at the bottom of the washer but by the electronics and it was suggested that I disconnect the DW from the power to 'reset' the timer, this I did and hit the 'Cancel' cycle a couple of times to make sure that all programs were cancelled. Whether any of this made a difference I have no idea - except that the dishwasher suddenly stopped leaking and hasn't leaked a drop for at least 20 washes. So I don't know, for sure, why it leaked or how I fixed it, but it's working and washing great now - except the tines on the lower rack are beginning to rust out and breaking off. The rack is pretty expensive but so far I've saved a lot of money and my family thinks I'm a dishwasher genius.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Dishes not rinsing well, particles left on dishes, How to Repair: As others have described, this replacement was very easy.

I took a pair of wire snips and just cut the old interlocking piece off. This way I didn't have to try and slide the two interlocking pieces apart.  When you go to put the new piece on before you interlock them make sure they are put on right. Specifically the latch is pointing the right way to seal the detergent door.

It was leaking from just above tne door front panel, directly underneath the control panel buttons. I opened the dishwasher door, and decided to remove the door screen vent.  I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered. I enjoyed solving the problem, and you all helped alot.

Note that the top of the spring has a square-end upside down ""U"" . This rests on a small ledge on the detergent box.  Also note that on either end of the spring is a straight extension of the spring wire.

I was not sure of problem and thought that a new Dishwasher may be needed if motor was the problem. After taking the bottom rack and spray arms out I came across my first problem. I believe it was the impeller design that has a 1in hex nut with a bolt in middle that needed to be removed. I needed a 90 degree 1in wrench to hold impleller while I removed Bolt. Luckly I have a friend that is a mechinist who made me a wrench.After that the grinding cause was discovered - Broken glass that grinded the cermic shaft that is over motor shaft. I did not small drops of water under motor during grinding due to damaged cermic shaft.$24 and  2 days later my dishwasher is as good as new.

There are two small rubber pieces located in mounting slots below the door gasket that slide out; I slide the old ones out and slide the new ones in.

That is an amazing service. When it arrived I noticed that the new part was re-designed but the dimensions appeared to be identical. Initially it was difficult to snap it in to position but with help of a screw driver it finally snapped in place. After re-installation of the upper wash arm all looked perfect.  But the arm would not spin freely.  It would bind against the bottom of the upper tray. Finally after about 20 minutes I noticed that the mount was slightly slanted to one side. This was not immediately apparent unless you look carefully. Further I noticed that the bottom of the upper tray was protruding lower on the right side. Finally I realized why the mount was slanted to one side.  I removed the mount and turned it 180 deg.. Bingo all fits and works perfectly. I could have avoided the problems if an orientation directions were included with the mount. I suspect that a less technical individual would likely not figure it out.}', '{Installation Issue: Top Water Tube hose broken., How to Repair: The part came so fast without extra shipping.

You will need to recycle two rubber bumpers, your old utensil basket and the cone in the center of the rack. Getting the cone free was not easy. It has to be rotated to release it from the wire rack. I had to pry it free with a screwdriver. Once rotated it lifted out easily. I noted how the cone lined up in the old rack and installed it the same way in the new rack.

First I looked it up on the internet. All kind of results, except for the model I was working on. Called, very nice woman directed me to yet another YouTube presentation for another model. As this was no help, I chose to not call her back. Not her fault.So, I did what every instruction for the other models called for, disconnect the power. Seemed like a good idea if everyone suggested it. After that, remove the inner door by removing the screws. At this point I would like to mention that I also ordered and paid for what I thought would be a set of inner door screws to replace the old and weathered ones. However, they sent me one screw.Who in their right mind would pay $5.10 for ONE SCREW? Well, your looking right at him. I felt like I sold the family cow for a magic bean, but that’s another story. So, without instructions, I compared the part I ordered with the one installed in the door. It matched up in many ways, with exception for the fact I would not budge from it’s position, wiggle yes, remove no. I stared at it for 10 minutes with no further progress. Something has to give. I decided to remove the cover of the electronics with the hopes and optimism of a child. It also did not want to be removed. Back to YouTube and the computer. Nothing. I stared at it for another 10 minutes. Drank a beer, and started to “horse” it off, somehow it became ajar, and was finally removed. Upon examination of the old door latch bolt, I noticed that it was attached to the electronic mass by 4 wires. I used my phone camera to record which went where with false hopes that the repair was in reach. It was either me or the dishwasher. At this point, good money was on the dishwasher.After recording and removal of said wires, I took the entire door latch and whatever the other piece was, to a table for further study, and another beer. After said study and beer, I remembered looking at other parts, one came to mind, a small teflon rod. As I look upon the part I knew about, I noticed it was adhering to the alien part with wires by 2 small teflon rods. I found a small nail, and pushed them out of the part, and they final separated. I replaced the old part with the new one and then  reversed all steps and procedures, attached wires, reattached electronic cover, screwed down the inner door, shut main door, and started a dish cycle. Works perfectly. You may ask about the expensive screw. I took it to a local jeweler, who found nothing remarkable about it. As there must be SOMETHING about it that makes it valuable, so I had it mounted and framed in a nice display case for friends and family to treasure for years to come.

As others have stated this is a new design but directly replaceable and easy to do.This didn't solve the cleaning issue so reading the experiences of others on this site realized I also had broken parts in the Upper Spray Arm Assembly and the Upper Wash assembly. I replaced these and the dishes were suddenly much, much cleaner. These were very easily replaced.I did find that I did not need the Mount for the upper spray arm (PS402277) as a redesign of the Upper Spray Arm Mounting bracket no longer required it - the bracket simply clipped in -the diagram was out of date. Everything seemed to go well for about 3 loads when the dishwasher started leaking heavily out of the bottom of the door. I then noticed that the lower Wash Arm Bearing Ring and the Seal, Lower Spray Arm had disintegrated so I replaced those but this didn't affect the leaking. Someone had stated that if the lower wash arm assembly had too much 'wobble' that it cause 'waves' that would leak out the front door... mine had some wobble so I added a nylon washer from Ace Hardware that reduced wobble but still leaked.I then replaced the Door Seal Kit - this was by far the most difficult part as the door needed to be removed and it was somewhat difficult - and it seemed apparent after we had removed the door that these parts weren't the problem but we replaced them anyway. Also, someone else had noted that they had to attach the door seal (this is NOT the gasket that goes around the door opening) with a sealant - I had the same problem; the original seal fit tightly with friction but the new replacement required an adhesive - I used silicone. Still leaked.From here on I can't guaratee any useful information: I took the strainer screen out of the bottom of the dishwasher and found one slightly loose screw holding what I believe is the 'pump outlet' according to the diagram. I had also read that the water fill is controlled not by the float at the bottom of the washer but by the electronics and it was suggested that I disconnect the DW from the power to 'reset' the timer, this I did and hit the 'Cancel' cycle a couple of times to make sure that all programs were cancelled. Whether any of this made a difference I have no idea - except that the dishwasher suddenly stopped leaking and hasn't leaked a drop for at least 20 washes. So I don't know, for sure, why it leaked or how I fixed it, but it's working and washing great now - except the tines on the lower rack are beginning to rust out and breaking off. The rack is pretty expensive but so far I've saved a lot of money and my family thinks I'm a dishwasher genius.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Dishes not rinsing well, particles left on dishes, How to Repair: As others have described, this replacement was very easy.

I removed the interior side of the door and then the plastic covering over the electrical wires and switches (I counterbalanced the door with a couple of half gallon juice containers).  I removed the wires attached to the switch on the door handle and the door handle itself.  The handle and switch parts disassembled and I replaced the switches (part of kit).  I cut off the singed wire and the other three beyond the damaged portion and stripped the wires and connected the extensions (part of kit).  I attached the new wires to the switches and closed up the interior door.  Lastly, I turned the circuit breaker back on.  All was well!}', '{Installation Issue: Water dripped out from the bottom of door., How to Repair: Diagnosing the problem, i.e. finding the source of the leak, was the hardest part. The best clue was the leak only occurred well into the cycle when the water was hot and steam was coming out the vent. I then assumed there was a bad seal and steam & condensed water was leaking down into the door. I replaced the vent duct & seal, a broken drip cover (an internal part in the door), and replaced a missing rinse aid cap. This stopped the leak.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher would not fill with water., How to Repair: After doing some research in a repair book I decided to take  a stab with a water inlet valve. With expedited shipping I ordered the part and within three days it was delivered. I installed it and the dishwasher seemed like it was trying to fill but still would not. After much cocnsternation I turned the water supply valve to the dishwasher a partial turn to close and I felt the water rush through the valve and the dishwasher then filled. Apparently the shut off valve must have been clogged plus it now leaked. I then replaced the shutoff valve and the copper pipe to the water inlet valve with flexible 3/8"" tubing and the dishwasher thus far is running fine without leaks.}', '{Installation Issue: Upper nozzle ""spinner"" had degraded to the point where it no longer worked, How to Repair: The only difficult part was taking out (relatively easy) and returning (hard) the clips from the rails.

There was only a metal ring and it was supposed to have a spring attached to it. I replaced the ring/spring below the wash impeller using the part from the Drain and Wash impeller kit.

Right parts, right price.Removed the upper arm assembly, T15 screwdriver, the screen strainer, the impeller, T25 screwdriver, the food grinding spring and impeller (the grinding noise, spring was sprung), and finally the post and impeller thingie (had to break it off, very brittle). The pieces went back on a lot more smoothly than it took to get them off!  Use your digital camera! I took pictures of every  stage of the parts removal and what I removed.

We received them the next day. I had to remove one of the screws from the old kit, since the new one only came with one. I looked at the diagram on the website of the assembly, and also remembered what the assembly looked like before I took it apart. The first time I tried it, I could not get the spray arm to spin without hitting the dishwasher rack. Since I had ran out of time, I had to wait until the next day. Once I started, I realized that I had the mounting bracket on backwards. Once I turned it around, I tightened the screws, and it was done within 5 minutes.}', '{Installation Issue: Broken upper rack pivot clip, How to Repair: As others have said, installing this part is more difficult than it looks.  First, it is a bit of a jigsaw puzzle.  It is not intuitive which part should be attached first.  I also found that part that clips onto the the bottom of the ""rail"" was just too tight.  After a little surgery with an razor blade, I got it to fit.  Also, there are at least 3 different pivot clips for the upper rack.  Pay attention to the diagram when ordering.

My dishwasher is close to 18 years old and I think that was part of the problem.  After soaking in WD40, I finally got the valve out.  Then I had to remove the ""L"" shaped connector to put on the new valve.  Everything went back together a lot faster and it\'s like I have a new dishwasher again.

This is the disk with swirl pattern on the back face., How to Repair: 1) Removed the two white clips from the left and righ hand side of the top tray roller rail.  this allows the tray to be completely removed and ease access to the washer assembly.   The clipe looks like the letter ""k"", so you will need to close the ""k"" to almost straight line in order to get it through the hole.2) Put a sheet or a towel at the bottom of the machine, just incase you drop the two small cross head screws.  This prevents the screws from falling to the bottom of the machine.3) Remove the screws.  At this time the washer assembly will/should slip out very easily. very little force is required to pull the assmbely out.4) Slip on the new washer assembly and put the screws back in place.  Tighten screws,  Be careful not over tighten the screw as you may crack the plastic flange.  Note:  My machine is an older model, so the washer assembly had two screw fixing.  The new assembly only had one hole.

It was leaking from just above tne door front panel, directly underneath the control panel buttons. I opened the dishwasher door, and decided to remove the door screen vent.  I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered.

Also note that on either end of the spring is a straight extension of the spring wire.

I did not small drops of water under motor during grinding due to damaged cermic shaft.$24 and  2 days later my dishwasher is as good as new.

But the arm would not spin freely.  It would bind against the bottom of the upper tray. Finally after about 20 minutes I noticed that the mount was slightly slanted to one side. This was not immediately apparent unless you look carefully. Further I noticed that the bottom of the upper tray was protruding lower on the right side. Finally I realized why the mount was slanted to one side.  I removed the mount and turned it 180 deg.. Bingo all fits and works perfectly.

First I looked it up on the internet. All kind of results, except for the model I was working on. Called, very nice woman directed me to yet another YouTube presentation for another model. As this was no help, I chose to not call her back. Not her fault.So, I did what every instruction for the other models called for, disconnect the power. Seemed like a good idea if everyone suggested it. After that, remove the inner door by removing the screws. At this point I would like to mention that I also ordered and paid for what I thought would be a set of inner door screws to replace the old and weathered ones. However, they sent me one screw.Who in their right mind would pay $5.10 for ONE SCREW? Well, your looking right at him. I felt like I sold the family cow for a magic bean, but that’s another story. So, without instructions, I compared the part I ordered with the one installed in the door. It matched up in many ways, with exception for the fact I would not budge from it’s position, wiggle yes, remove no. I stared at it for 10 minutes with no further progress. Something has to give. I decided to remove the cover of the electronics with the hopes and optimism of a child. It also did not want to be removed. Back to YouTube and the computer. Nothing. I stared at it for another 10 minutes. Drank a beer, and started to “horse” it off, somehow it became ajar, and was finally removed. Upon examination of the old door latch bolt, I noticed that it was attached to the electronic mass by 4 wires. I used my phone camera to record which went where with false hopes that the repair was in reach. It was either me or the dishwasher. At this point, good money was on the dishwasher.After recording and removal of said wires, I took the entire door latch and whatever the other piece was, to a table for further study, and another beer. After said study and beer, I remembered looking at other parts, one came to mind, a small teflon rod. As I look upon the part I knew about, I noticed it was adhering to the alien part with wires by 2 small teflon rods. I found a small nail, and pushed them out of the part, and they final separated. I replaced the old part with the new one and then  reversed all steps and procedures, attached wires, reattached electronic cover, screwed down the inner door, shut main door, and started a dish cycle. Works perfectly. You may ask about the expensive screw. I took it to a local jeweler, who found nothing remarkable about it. As there must be SOMETHING about it that makes it valuable, so I had it mounted and framed in a nice display case for friends and family to treasure for years to come. A real conversation piece, and one more thing to dust.}', '{Installation Issue: Glasses and dishes had cooked on film on them due to no upper spinner rinse., How to Repair: Need needle nose pliers to remove the keepers in the end stops on basket rails.

As others have stated this is a new design but directly replaceable and easy to do.This didn't solve the cleaning issue so reading the experiences of others on this site realized I also had broken parts in the Upper Spray Arm Assembly and the Upper Wash assembly. I replaced these and the dishes were suddenly much, much cleaner. These were very easily replaced.I did find that I did not need the Mount for the upper spray arm (PS402277) as a redesign of the Upper Spray Arm Mounting bracket no longer required it - the bracket simply clipped in -the diagram was out of date. Everything seemed to go well for about 3 loads when the dishwasher started leaking heavily out of the bottom of the door. I then noticed that the lower Wash Arm Bearing Ring and the Seal, Lower Spray Arm had disintegrated so I replaced those but this didn't affect the leaking. Someone had stated that if the lower wash arm assembly had too much 'wobble' that it cause 'waves' that would leak out the front door... mine had some wobble so I added a nylon washer from Ace Hardware that reduced wobble but still leaked.I then replaced the Door Seal Kit - this was by far the most difficult part as the door needed to be removed and it was somewhat difficult - and it seemed apparent after we had removed the door that these parts weren't the problem but we replaced them anyway. Also, someone else had noted that they had to attach the door seal (this is NOT the gasket that goes around the door opening) with a sealant - I had the same problem; the original seal fit tightly with friction but the new replacement required an adhesive - I used silicone. Still leaked.From here on I can't guaratee any useful information: I took the strainer screen out of the bottom of the dishwasher and found one slightly loose screw holding what I believe is the 'pump outlet' according to the diagram. I had also read that the water fill is controlled not by the float at the bottom of the washer but by the electronics and it was suggested that I disconnect the DW from the power to 'reset' the timer, this I did and hit the 'Cancel' cycle a couple of times to make sure that all programs were cancelled. Whether any of this made a difference I have no idea - except that the dishwasher suddenly stopped leaking and hasn't leaked a drop for at least 20 washes. So I don't know, for sure, why it leaked or how I fixed it, but it's working and washing great now - except the tines on the lower rack are beginning to rust out and breaking off. The rack is pretty expensive but so far I've saved a lot of money and my family thinks I'm a dishwasher genius.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Dishes not rinsing well, particles left on dishes, How to Repair: As others have described, this replacement was very easy. The new spray arm is solid plastic instead of rubber (which had deteriorated and was the part that needed replacing).

I took a pair of wire snips and just cut the old interlocking piece off. This way I didn't have to try and slide the two interlocking pieces apart.  When you go to put the new piece on before you interlock them make sure they are put on right. Specifically the latch is pointing the right way to seal the detergent door.

After much cocnsternation I turned the water supply valve to the dishwasher a partial turn to close and I felt the water rush through the valve and the dishwasher then filled.

It was leaking from just above tne door front panel, directly underneath the control panel buttons. I opened the dishwasher door, and decided to remove the door screen vent.  I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered.

First I looked it up on the internet. All kind of results, except for the model I was working on. Called, very nice woman directed me to yet another YouTube presentation for another model. As this was no help, I chose to not call her back. Not her fault.So, I did what every instruction for the other models called for, disconnect the power. Seemed like a good idea if everyone suggested it. After that, remove the inner door by removing the screws. At this point I would like to mention that I also ordered and paid for what I thought would be a set of inner door screws to replace the old and weathered ones. However, they sent me one screw.Who in their right mind would pay $5.10 for ONE SCREW? Well, your looking right at him. I felt like I sold the family cow for a magic bean, but that’s another story. So, without instructions, I compared the part I ordered with the one installed in the door. It matched up in many ways, with exception for the fact I would not budge from it’s position, wiggle yes, remove no. I stared at it for 10 minutes with no further progress. Something has to give. I decided to remove the cover of the electronics with the hopes and optimism of a child. It also did not want to be removed. Back to YouTube and the computer. Nothing. I stared at it for another 10 minutes. Drank a beer, and started to “horse” it off, somehow it became ajar, and was finally removed. Upon examination of the old door latch bolt, I noticed that it was attached to the electronic mass by 4 wires. I used my phone camera to record which went where with false hopes that the repair was in reach. It was either me or the dishwasher. At this point, good money was on the dishwasher.After recording and removal of said wires, I took the entire door latch and whatever the other piece was, to a table for further study, and another beer. After said study and beer, I remembered looking at other parts, one came to mind, a small teflon rod. As I look upon the part I knew about, I noticed it was adhering to the alien part with wires by 2 small teflon rods. I found a small nail, and pushed them out of the part, and they final separated. I replaced the old part with the new one and then  reversed all steps and procedures, attached wires, reattached electronic cover, screwed down the inner door, shut main door, and started a dish cycle. Works perfectly. You may ask about the expensive screw. I took it to a local jeweler, who found nothing remarkable about it. As there must be SOMETHING about it that makes it valuable, so I had it mounted and framed in a nice display case for friends and family to treasure for years to come.

As others have stated this is a new design but directly replaceable and easy to do.This didn't solve the cleaning issue so reading the experiences of others on this site realized I also had broken parts in the Upper Spray Arm Assembly and the Upper Wash assembly. I replaced these and the dishes were suddenly much, much cleaner. These were very easily replaced.I did find that I did not need the Mount for the upper spray arm (PS402277) as a redesign of the Upper Spray Arm Mounting bracket no longer required it - the bracket simply clipped in -the diagram was out of date. Everything seemed to go well for about 3 loads when the dishwasher started leaking heavily out of the bottom of the door. I then noticed that the lower Wash Arm Bearing Ring and the Seal, Lower Spray Arm had disintegrated so I replaced those but this didn't affect the leaking. Someone had stated that if the lower wash arm assembly had too much 'wobble' that it cause 'waves' that would leak out the front door... mine had some wobble so I added a nylon washer from Ace Hardware that reduced wobble but still leaked.I then replaced the Door Seal Kit - this was by far the most difficult part as the door needed to be removed and it was somewhat difficult - and it seemed apparent after we had removed the door that these parts weren't the problem but we replaced them anyway. Also, someone else had noted that they had to attach the door seal (this is NOT the gasket that goes around the door opening) with a sealant - I had the same problem; the original seal fit tightly with friction but the new replacement required an adhesive - I used silicone. Still leaked.From here on I can't guaratee any useful information: I took the strainer screen out of the bottom of the dishwasher and found one slightly loose screw holding what I believe is the 'pump outlet' according to the diagram. I had also read that the water fill is controlled not by the float at the bottom of the washer but by the electronics and it was suggested that I disconnect the DW from the power to 'reset' the timer, this I did and hit the 'Cancel' cycle a couple of times to make sure that all programs were cancelled. Whether any of this made a difference I have no idea - except that the dishwasher suddenly stopped leaking and hasn't leaked a drop for at least 20 washes. So I don't know, for sure, why it leaked or how I fixed it, but it's working and washing great now - except the tines on the lower rack are beginning to rust out and breaking off.

I took the part to the kitchen sink and used the sprayer hose on the part with hot water and it cleaned up beautifully, and the detergent latch then worked ( the spring that operates the latch was all gucked up with detergent accumulation ). I am the wife and did all of this myself and it only took around 5-10 min. My Husband had to help me figure out the type of screws because they turned out to not be phillip screws, but as Hubby called them..""star screws"".Soooo, I did not need to use the Latch Kit  I purchased, so will store it in my parts supply! :)Happy repairs to you..Judy    Estes Park, CO}', '{Installation Issue: upper spray and middle spray arms had broken apart due to age leaving unusable., How to Repair: The video offered was perfect and walked me through the exact process and gave me the confidence i could handle this repair myself.

Flawless in every aspect.  i would recommend your company.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher Rehab, How to Repair: After hearing ominous grinding sounds and water leaking around the gasket, it was about time to rehab the dishwasher. This is usually the point where I say ""t\'hell with it, buy a new one"". I am glad I didn\'t.The Kit to rehab the impeller and such had EVERYTHING I needed. Right parts, right price.Removed the upper arm assembly, T15 screwdriver, the screen strainer, the impeller, T25 screwdriver, the food grinding spring and impeller (the grinding noise, spring was sprung), and finally the post and impeller thingie (had to break it off, very brittle). The pieces went back on a lot more smoothly than it took to get them off!  Use your digital camera! I took pictures of every  stage of the parts removal and what I removed. I got confused with some little balls that were inside and the pictures told me exactly where they went. Door gasket? I should have replaced it YEARS ago, so easy and cheap with PartSelect parts.}', '{Installation Issue: upper rack would not pull out easily, How to Repair: Replaced both ""tracks""  and the ""wheels"" .Now it\'s like new....!!My wife is so happyRemoved the track end caps from the tracks so I could pull out the tracks.Removed the upper wash rack that holds dishes.  Only by removing this rack can the wheels be replaced, if I tried to replace them with the rack attached to the dishwasher I had to bend forward painfully.Replace the old rales with new ones.Attach new wheels to the upper rack in such a way as to allow the rack to roll inside the new rales.Replace the end caps.Hope it lasts another 10 years}', '{Installation Issue: Valve was leaking from plastic after water line change, How to Repair: Turned of water and unplugged the dishwasher.Disconnected the incoming water line.Drained on to the floor (have paper towels ready)Disconnected the electrical feed wire.Disconnected the rubber hose.Unscrewed screw holding the fixture to the frame.Took off the brass elbow from the old part.Put pipedope around it and screwed into new part (carefully, so as to not crack plastic again).Attached part back to frame.Attached water lines.Turned on water, plugged it in and ran dishwasher looking for leaks.  No problem.}', '{Installation Issue: The spray arm snapped off from the mounting bracket., How to Repair: First of all, we were very impressed with the ease of finding the parts, the ordering, and the velocity in which the parts were shipped. We received them the next day. I had to remove one of the screws from the old kit, since the new one only came with one. I looked at the diagram on the website of the assembly, and also remembered what the assembly looked like before I took it apart. The first time I tried it, I could not get the spray arm to spin without hitting the dishwasher rack. Since I had ran out of time, I had to wait until the next day. Once I started, I realized that I had the mounting bracket on backwards. Once I turned it around, I tightened the screws, and it was done within 5 minutes.}', '{Installation Issue: Broken upper rack pivot clip, How to Repair: As others have said, installing this part is more difficult than it looks.  First, it is a bit of a jigsaw puzzle.  It is not intuitive which part should be attached first.  I also found that part that clips onto the the bottom of the ""rail"" was just too tight.  After a little surgery with an razor blade, I got it to fit.  Also, there are at least 3 different pivot clips for the upper rack.  Pay attention to the diagram when ordering.  (I didn\'t the first time, wrongly assuming that a pivot clip was a pivot clip.)}', ""{Installation Issue: Dishwasher leaking water out the front door., How to Repair: replaced the two water defiector's, I had changed the door seal and should have changed the defiectors at the same time. Save yourself some time and ordor both parts. This is a easy fix, anyone can do.}"", '{Installation Issue: No water coming into dishwasher, How to Repair: I unscrewed the old water inlet valve from the frame of the dishwasher so that I could manuever  my hand around to the backside where the rubber hose was connected.  That was the easy part.  I then had trouble holding the old valve while trying to unscrew the hot water copper tubing so I screwed it back on the frame.  My dishwasher is close to 18 years old and I think that was part of the problem.  After soaking in WD40, I finally got the valve out.  Then I had to remove the ""L"" shaped connector to put on the new valve.  Everything went back together a lot faster and it\'s like I have a new dishwasher again.  By the way, I am a 53 year old female so that may be why it took me so long.}', '{Installation Issue: O ring seal was streched out allowing a leak, How to Repair: Removed 5 or 6 screws replaced O ring,Srewed cover back on ,no more leak.}', '{Installation Issue: Water leak from center of motor unit, How to Repair: Removed dishwasher, take to garage, removed lower rack to gain access to top of motor unit. Used star socket wrench to remove upper screws holding top of unit in. Disconnect wires, drain tube and counter weight. pulled motor unit out from inside dishwasher and placed on bench. Proceeded to disassemble motor. Some things were obvious, others not so. replaced old worn out parts with new, used a little lube (Vaseline) in places to assist in getting seals back in place. Instructions were of little help need to pay close attention when tearing unit apart.  Reassembled with new seals, installed motor and re-installed dishwasher...NO LEAKS!! Wife and I happy.}', '{Installation Issue: Latch broke on Dishwasher, How to Repair: Had to pull the dishwashwer out to replace the latch.  Did this by unscrewing the 2 screws that hold the Dishwashwer to the under side of the counter.  Dishwasher then pulled out easily.  Then unscrewed to screws on the latch.  The screws were accessed by pulling out the modling/strip around the dishwasher door.  Also easy to replace the screws.   But sliding it back in was a little harder.  Had to shorten the front legs on the dishwashwer to get the back of the dishwasher to go back in.  Then screw the front legs back out.  Finally re-inserted the screws under the counter that attached the top of the Dishwasher to the counter top.}', '{Installation Issue: No heat. Replaced thermostat, How to Repair: Was able to replace and repair without taking the dishwasher out. Thermostat is behind and to the left of the power junction box.            Has 2 wires going to it. It is up against the bottom of tub. I used an angled mirror to see what I was doing. 1 small screw to detach and pull down thermostat. Be sure power is off before you start. Also reprogrammed defaults. Hit any button 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, fast and close door. Let it sit 15 min to run and re-set defaults. Now I have heat and dry dishes.}', '{Installation Issue: Replaced silverware basket, How to Repair: No brainer}', '{Installation Issue: dishwasher leaks from left side of door, How to Repair: The old gasket came out easily, but had calcium deposits in area. I cleaned the area with vinegar and water and waited until it was completely dry. The new gasket went in very easily and looked great. I started the dishwasher and alas, it still leaks, so the problem was apparently not with the gasket, but some other area. But the gasket is nice and new. Any suggestions on next step0 in troubleshooting?}', '{Installation Issue: The plastic disc which sprays the jet has snapped off.  This is the disk with swirl pattern on the back face., How to Repair: 1) Removed the two white clips from the left and righ hand side of the top tray roller rail.  this allows the tray to be completely removed and ease access to the washer assembly.   The clipe looks like the letter ""k"", so you will need to close the ""k"" to almost straight line in order to get it through the hole.2) Put a sheet or a towel at the bottom of the machine, just incase you drop the two small cross head screws.  This prevents the screws from falling to the bottom of the machine.3) Remove the screws.  At this time the washer assembly will/should slip out very easily. very little force is required to pull the assmbely out.4) Slip on the new washer assembly and put the screws back in place.  Tighten screws,  Be careful not over tighten the screw as you may crack the plastic flange.  Note:  My machine is an older model, so the washer assembly had two screw fixing.  The new assembly only had one hole.  Although one fixing appeared to be sufficient, I decided to drill a hole on the other side and this worked fine.5) Replace the top tray, taking some care to ensure rollers are correctly located within the rails.  Then replace the clips and job\'s complete.}', ""{Installation Issue: Steam venting past gasket causing short in switch at handle lock., How to Repair: Removed inner cover of door. Pried Vent Assembly from door, peeled off thin sponge gasket strip from inner door, installed new thin sponge gasket strip on inner door vent opening bottom, snapped Vent Assembly into inner door opening, reinstalled inner door cover to door.Recommend removing Vent screen from inner door first to expose locking tabs of Vent Assembly to ease removal and installation of Vent Assembly.

My dad thought he would just get down there and do it, but wasn't sure what to do. Using the directions with the kit, I had the motor and pump off in under 5 minutes. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS WITH THE KIT!Some things to note:- Get some towels/cups/bowls, we had some water leaking from the dishwasher and hoses.- Be careful removing the dishwasher from the counters, go slow.1.

The new wheels came with the new axles already attached, and the whole wheel just snapped onto the lower rack. I ordered 6 and they arrived quickly and attached within minutes, and the dishwasher actually works better now that the rack is raised properly. Thank you!}', '{Installation Issue: One of the roller shafts broke, How to Repair: To remove the upper rack guide end caps, pull the inside flange gently to the rear, then twist the cap out of the track.

One or two drops of water per cycle, which evaporates quickly and not worth taking apart again.It was not hard but took longer than predicted.Much better than buying a new dishwasher or paying the estimated $350 to an appliance repair company.}', '{Installation Issue: interlock switch was bad. Prevents the dishwasher form running as it ""thinks"" the door is still open., How to Repair: Opened door, removed screw holding down metal plate that presses against interlock switch when door is closed.

Removed new interlock switch from plastic bag and reversed above procedure. Done, shut door and the dishwasher works.}', ""{Installation Issue: Wouldn't Keep Water In Dishwasher - Bad Drain Solenoid, How to Repair: Rather than remove the dishwasher from the counter, I performed the repair inplace, which was much less work (although I did have to lay on the floor).After turning off the power, I removed the two access panels at the bottom of the unit, disconnected the wiring from the pump and solenoid, loosened the drain hose fitting and drained most of the water out of the unit and into a shallow pan (the drain solenoid was stuck open, so this was pretty easy - otherwise, I still could have manually actuated the drain valve & solenoid to drain water through this hose).There was alot of water in the unit and my pan overflowed a little.  If I was doing this again, think I would have disconnected the drain hose from under the sink and drained out through that into a bucket (I could have controlled that flow better).Once the water was out, there are just two hose clamps that hold the pump onto the unit (one on top and one in the back), and a stabilizer bar that connects the motor to the front frame.  Removed these and the whole unit came right out.The replacement pump & motor was exactly the same as the one that came out, so I didn't need any of the hose or wire adapters that came in the kit.  Reconnected the two pump connections, motor bracket and wiring, and the unit was good-to-go!}"", ""{Installation Issue: Small leak below lower right corner of door, How to Repair: I took the inner door panel off as described by others on this website, cleaned out all the gunk left by 27 yrs of use, and replaced the door gasket and tub baffles.  A Phillips-head screwdriver was required to remove the door panel, but no tools were required to replace any of the parts I ordered.  I didn't find it necessary to soak the door gasket in warm water as it was pretty flexible right out of the package.  I recommend stretching the gasket slightly while pressing it into the groove, particularly around corners, or it will end up being too short at the end.  The rinse aid tank had also been leaking Jet-Dry for a long time, so I cleaned that mess up as well and tried to replace the tank.  Unfortunately, the new tank did not fit my model of dishwasher even though this website and GE's stated that it did.  The shaft on the tank that pokes through the inner door panel to the inside of the dishwasher was too short because >2 mm of it was taken up by a thick rubber washer and a hard plastic collar (fused to the shaft to hold the washer in place) that had not been part of my original rinse aid tank.  PartSelect was very good about refunding me for the incorrectly identified rinse aid tank and stated that they would contact GE about correcting this error on their website as well.  I therefore cleaned up my original rinse aid tank, rinsing out all Jet-Dry residue inside it, and put it back into the inner door panel.  I researched this part and found that GE has redesigned it twice since my dishwasher was manufactured in 1985 -- my original part is no longer available anywhere.  So, I will just not use Jet-Dry and will maybe upgrade to a dishwasher powder that includes rinse agent (e.g., Cascade Complete).  Replacing the gasket and tub baffles and cleaning up my original rinse aid tank stopped the leak for less than the cost of a repairman's service call and diagnosis fees -- it would have cost me 3X more if he had provided the parts and done the repairs!  Replacing my dishwasher was out of the question as they do not make them like they used to (i.e., no microchips or motherboards to fail in a few years) -- this is the first problem I've had with my dishwasher in 27 years!  As a side note, I also learned from my research that my front door panel insert is reversible.  I was able to remove a side trim piece, slide out the panel, and turn it over so the color is now white rather than the outdated almond.  It's like I have a brand new dishwasher that is ready to go for another 27 years.}"", '{Installation Issue: Nothing more than a worn out check valve,easilly accessible and easilly changed. The valve wouldnt close fully due to deteriation of the piston stopper., How to Repair: Removed bottom tray from the dishwasher and in the back there is a screen with 5 hex head screws.

Reversed order for reassembly.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher not draining, How to Repair: Found great information on this site describing the problem.  My 9 year old GE Triton dishwasher has not been draining. I thought at first it was something stuck in float somewhere or perhaps a bad pump, but after searching around, I found this site and other stories similar to mine.  Most of the reports suggested a worn check valve in the floor of the dishwasher tub, apparently a common issue with some GE models.  I removed the strainer located at the back of the tub (4 screws removed w/ 1/4"" nutdriver),  then unscrewed the check valve to inspect it.  Saw that the valve seat was very worn.  Ordered the replacement part, received it 4 days later and installed in less than 10 minutes.  The best part was I didn\'t have to remove the dishwasher or crawl underneath to complete the repair.

My theory was to have the parts so that the dishwasher was not apart for longer than necessary, in the hope of avoiding the wrath of momma bear who just wants a new one...  Once I opened up the door I realized the spring for the main lever arm had broken its mount.  I drilled a new hole and reattached the spring.  I did not need any parts.  However, the original parts corresponding to the three parts I ordered were all beat up and brittle, so I was happy to replace anyway.  I did not even explain, she is happy the cup looks new and is happy with the dishwasher.  It even says Cascade on it, almost like an upgrade :).  If your cup does not latch I would order the three parts I did and also order the lever spring.  It was very corroded after 30 years, so I would have replaced if I purchased it.

I tightened the hose clamps, Installed the new screw and support bar to the motor, and connected the electrical plug.  I then turned the dishwasher upright, reconnected the power cord, water supply and drain lines and started a wash cycle to check the new system for leaks.

There were actually instructions included with the parts, so that was nice. The only ""gotcha"" I found was that . . . after you take off the old food-chopper, you have unscrew the old impeller from the motor shaft. This was a bit difficult and you\'ll want some good pliers to do it. Don\'t worry about stripping where the food chopper screwed on-to, that part is attached to the impeller and there is a new one on the new impeller.  When I re-installed everything onto the dishwasher, it rattled the first couple of times while the wear-ring was finding it\'s seat. Don\'t worry, that\'s normal. It went away by the third wash.  I think I still have a small crack in the pump housing, though. The pump housing is two halves of molded plastic fused together along a seam, and I think the seam is starting to leak.

Reviewing the cost of a new dishwasher at the big box stores convinced me replacing the part would be much less money., How to Repair: I had hoped to be able to do the entire replacement at the floor level through the front panel without moving the dishwasher out of the cabinet.  That turned out to be impossible because two of the machine screws holding in the old pump rusted and would not budge.     I did however manage to do the replacement by moving the dishwasher only 16 to 18"" out of the cabinet so that I could work on more than one side.  A word of advice:  Once the pump is disconnected get it out of the house as soon as possible.  It will continue to leak on your floor otherwise.   No point in getting your pants, shirt and tools all wet.     The best part of this replacement came when I buttoned the whole thing back-up and ran it.  This new pump was significantly less noisy than the old one making it possible to stay in the kitchen and actually have a conversation with someone.  (My dog no longer leaves either.)

I pulled off the plastic end caps to the top rack that allows the roller wheels to be pulled out of the aluminum rails.  You need to push in the raised edge of the plastic caps so they clear the rail slot in order to remove them.  This takes a little bit of finger pressure or you can use a flat-edge screw driver to pop them out.  2. Once this procedure is completed, you simply remove the rack and rollers from both rails and remove the old roller wheels and replace them with the new ones.  3. I used a phillips-head screw driver to tighten up the rail wheels before re-installing the top rack into the rails and then re-inserted the end caps.  Pliers are handy to help get the end caps back into the rail slots.  4. I finally used a silcon spray on all of the rolling parts of the top tray assembly for lubrication.}', '{Installation Issue: Replace rinse aid fill cap, How to Repair: Opened the package and screwed in the new rinse aid fill cap.

The only difficulty I had was getting to the motor which required taking the bottom section off of the dishwasher. I could not get an appliance repair company to work on an LG dishwasher. My only option was to repair the dishwasher or bought a new dishwasher. Therefore, my wife and I decided to , make an attempt to repair this one with a backup plan of buying a new one. Luckily, we were able to fix this one within two hours. This was a $999 dishwasher.

I simply selected the drain pump because it was cheaper and  because it was making a clicking noise. (The only significant noise that this dishwasher was making)  To be safe, I unplugged the unit and turned off the water, under the sink. I removed the kick plate and I unscrewed the anchor clips from under the counter and carefully pulled the unit out.  I then opened the dishwasher and removed the lower rack. To minimize water clean-up, I took a rag and soaked up the standing water in the bottom until it was nearly dry.  I then tipped the dishwasher on it\'s left side, knowing where the location of  the drain pump (front, right), would be in an easier location for me to work. I first unplugged the pumps wiring. Then, with pliers, I was able to disconnect the clips on the short, rubber hoses that hold the pump in alignment.(Use caution: If reusing the same rubber hose(s) on the new pump, it will be easier if you put them on in the same direction as they were take off)  Then I removed the rubber supports off their hooks, that allow the pump to hang from the bottom of the dishwasher.  Once the rubber hoses are re-connected on the new pump and placed on to it\'s former proper alignment, you can re-attach the rubber supports to their hooks. And last, but not least, remember to plug the new pump\'s wires back in place. Carefully stand up dishwasher and push it slowly back into place.  I plugged in the unit and turned on the water.  Before I screwed the unit back to the counter and kick plate back on the front, I ran a load and watched for leaks beneath the new pumps area.  No leaks.

Shut the water supply off and removed water line at the dishwasher. 3. Disconnected the drain at the sink. 4. Removed the 2 retaining screws 1 on each side that secures the dishwasher in place. 4. Removed the upper and lower racks, Used a shop vac and sucked the water out of the bottom of the dishwasher. 5. Pulled the dishwasher out making sure the drain line came with it. 6.  Laid The dishwasher over on the back side to the floor. 7. Reinstalled pump with new hose clamps and hoses that came with the pump. ( it probably would have been easier to remove the pump with the dishwasher pulled out) reinstall the wire connection to the pump (snap in connection), connected the 2 new rubber hangers to pump and connected to the dishwasher . 8. Slide the dishwasher back in place and reconnect water line be sure and use some Teflon tape, reconnect electrical wiring, reconnect drain line, secure dishwasher with screws. Turn water on and check for leaks, turn electrical power back on. I ran the dishwasher to make sure it worked and make sure there weren’t any leaks before I installed the bottom cover plate.

Repair length of time will depend on what all you have to disconnect to get your dish washer out so you can remove both side panels where you will be able to access the door springs, etc.  There is a door spring on each side and I recommend replacing both connectors cords while you have the dishwasher out.  Mine were both broken.  One thing I noticed when doing my repair was that the bracket that is on the bottom of the door was not aligned properly to the small pulley that the connector cords travels under.  If yours is out of alignment you will be able to tell once you get the connector cord installed.  I used heavy pliers to bend the bracket slightly inward so the connector cords rides in the center of the pulley and not off to the outside as before.  This may be why mine broke in the first place.

I simply selected the drain pump because it was cheaper and  because it was making a clicking noise. (The only significant noise that this dishwasher was making)  To be safe, I unplugged the unit and turned off the water, under the sink. I removed the kick plate and I unscrewed the anchor clips from under the counter and carefully pulled the unit out.  I then opened the dishwasher and removed the lower rack. To minimize water clean-up, I took a rag and soaked up the standing water in the bottom until it was nearly dry.  I then tipped the dishwasher on it\'s left side, knowing where the location of  the drain pump (front, right), would be in an easier location for me to work. I first unplugged the pumps wiring. Then, with pliers, I was able to disconnect the clips on the short, rubber hoses that hold the pump in alignment.(Use caution: If reusing the same rubber hose(s) on the new pump, it will be easier if you put them on in the same direction as they were take off)  Then I removed the rubber supports off their hooks, that allow the pump to hang from the bottom of the dishwasher.  Once the rubber hoses are re-connected on the new pump and placed on to it\'s former proper alignment, you can re-attach the rubber supports to their hooks. And last, but not least, remember to plug the new pump\'s wires back in place. Carefully stand up dishwasher and push it slowly back into place.  I plugged in the unit and turned on the water.  Before I screwed the unit back to the counter and kick plate back on the front, I ran a load and watched for leaks beneath the new pumps area.  No leaks.

Shut the water supply off and removed water line at the dishwasher. 3. Disconnected the drain at the sink. 4. Removed the 2 retaining screws 1 on each side that secures the dishwasher in place. 4. Removed the upper and lower racks, Used a shop vac and sucked the water out of the bottom of the dishwasher. 5. Pulled the dishwasher out making sure the drain line came with it. 6.  Laid The dishwasher over on the back side to the floor. 7. Reinstalled pump with new hose clamps and hoses that came with the pump.

Slide the dishwasher back in place and reconnect water line be sure and use some Teflon tape, reconnect electrical wiring, reconnect drain line, secure dishwasher with screws.

I watched YouTube on how to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet. Afterwards, I removed the bottom of the dishwasher while it was laying flat to get to the motor and micro switch. The only difficulty I had was getting to the motor which required taking the bottom section off of the dishwasher. I could not get an appliance repair company to work on an LG dishwasher. My only option was to repair the dishwasher or bought a new dishwasher. Therefore, my wife and I decided to , make an attempt to repair this one with a backup plan of buying a new one.

Mine were both broken.  One thing I noticed when doing my repair was that the bracket that is on the bottom of the door was not aligned properly to the small pulley that the connector cords travels under.  If yours is out of alignment you will be able to tell once you get the connector cord installed.  I used heavy pliers to bend the bracket slightly inward so the connector cords rides in the center of the pulley and not off to the outside as before.  This may be why mine broke in the first place.

Turns out the work itself was quite simple. Pulled the dishwasher out, turned it over, and was able to easily replace the motor and pump assembly. The drain tube was also an easy replace. A couple key notes:1. I also purchased a new drain solenoid and impeller kit. Note that both of these items are already included in the Motor and Pump kit replacement. There is no need to by both, now I have extras.2. The end of the drain tube has to be trimmed if you are routing the drain tube to an air gap mounted on your kitchen sink. You have to cut the large diameter end of the tube to get to the narrow portion that will fit on your air gap.3. The first cycle you run with the new motor/pump assembly is noisy. When you first fire it up the components in the pump are all dry, and they squeal until the water gets to them.

Problem fixed.}', ""{Installation Issue: Wouldn't Keep Water In Dishwasher - Bad Drain Solenoid, How to Repair: Rather than remove the dishwasher from the counter, I performed the repair inplace, which was much less work (although I did have to lay on the floor).After turning off the power, I removed the two access panels at the bottom of the unit, disconnected the wiring from the pump and solenoid, loosened the drain hose fitting and drained most of the water out of the unit and into a shallow pan (the drain solenoid was stuck open, so this was pretty easy - otherwise, I still could have manually actuated the drain valve & solenoid to drain water through this hose).There was alot of water in the unit and my pan overflowed a little.  If I was doing this again, think I would have disconnected the drain hose from under the sink and drained out through that into a bucket (I could have controlled that flow better).Once the water was out, there are just two hose clamps that hold the pump onto the unit (one on top and one in the back), and a stabilizer bar that connects the motor to the front frame.  Removed these and the whole unit came right out.The replacement pump & motor was exactly the same as the one that came out, so I didn't need any of the hose or wire adapters that came in the kit.  Reconnected the two pump connections, motor bracket and wiring, and the unit was good-to-go!}"", ""{Installation Issue: Small leak below lower right corner of door, How to Repair: I took the inner door panel off as described by others on this website, cleaned out all the gunk left by 27 yrs of use, and replaced the door gasket and tub baffles.  A Phillips-head screwdriver was required to remove the door panel, but no tools were required to replace any of the parts I ordered.  I didn't find it necessary to soak the door gasket in warm water as it was pretty flexible right out of the package.  I recommend stretching the gasket slightly while pressing it into the groove, particularly around corners, or it will end up being too short at the end.  The rinse aid tank had also been leaking Jet-Dry for a long time, so I cleaned that mess up as well and tried to replace the tank.  Unfortunately, the new tank did not fit my model of dishwasher even though this website and GE's stated that it did.  The shaft on the tank that pokes through the inner door panel to the inside of the dishwasher was too short because >2 mm of it was taken up by a thick rubber washer and a hard plastic collar (fused to the shaft to hold the washer in place) that had not been part of my original rinse aid tank.  PartSelect was very good about refunding me for the incorrectly identified rinse aid tank and stated that they would contact GE about correcting this error on their website as well.  I therefore cleaned up my original rinse aid tank, rinsing out all Jet-Dry residue inside it, and put it back into the inner door panel.  I researched this part and found that GE has redesigned it twice since my dishwasher was manufactured in 1985 -- my original part is no longer available anywhere.  So, I will just not use Jet-Dry and will maybe upgrade to a dishwasher powder that includes rinse agent (e.g., Cascade Complete).  Replacing the gasket and tub baffles and cleaning up my original rinse aid tank stopped the leak for less than the cost of a repairman's service call and diagnosis fees -- it would have cost me 3X more if he had provided the parts and done the repairs!  Replacing my dishwasher was out of the question as they do not make them like they used to (i.e., no microchips or motherboards to fail in a few years) -- this is the first problem I've had with my dishwasher in 27 years!  As a side note, I also learned from my research that my front door panel insert is reversible.  I was able to remove a side trim piece, slide out the panel, and turn it over so the color is now white rather than the outdated almond.

My theory was to have the parts so that the dishwasher was not apart for longer than necessary, in the hope of avoiding the wrath of momma bear who just wants a new one...  Once I opened up the door I realized the spring for the main lever arm had broken its mount.  I drilled a new hole and reattached the spring.  I did not need any parts.  However, the original parts corresponding to the three parts I ordered were all beat up and brittle, so I was happy to replace anyway.  I did not even explain, she is happy the cup looks new and is happy with the dishwasher.  It even says Cascade on it, almost like an upgrade :).

I then removed the electrical plug to the motor and the screw holding the support rod to the motor.  Then I worked the loosened water connections apart and removed the pump and motor assembly.Then I removed the hose clamp and plug from one of the orifices on the new pump, and aligned all of the water connections and wiggled the new pump assembly into place.  I tightened the hose clamps, Installed the new screw and support bar to the motor, and connected the electrical plug.  I then turned the dishwasher upright, reconnected the power cord, water supply and drain lines and started a wash cycle to check the new system for leaks.  I found that the extraneous drain solenoid that came attached to the new pump was loose and rattling, so I secured the solenoid shaft and linkage to the pump housing with electrical tape to stop the rattling.}"", '{Installation Issue: tub corner baffles were falling apart, How to Repair: I opened the D/W door, used needle nose pliers to remove the old baffles.

There were actually instructions included with the parts, so that was nice. The only ""gotcha"" I found was that . . . after you take off the old food-chopper, you have unscrew the old impeller from the motor shaft. This was a bit difficult and you\'ll want some good pliers to do it. Don\'t worry about stripping where the food chopper screwed on-to, that part is attached to the impeller and there is a new one on the new impeller.  When I re-installed everything onto the dishwasher, it rattled the first couple of times while the wear-ring was finding it\'s seat. Don\'t worry, that\'s normal. It went away by the third wash.  I think I still have a small crack in the pump housing, though. The pump housing is two halves of molded plastic fused together along a seam, and I think the seam is starting to leak. It\'s about one drop every 45 seconds.

Replaced it with the new motor and pump, reconnected the electrical plug ins, added an adapter hose part, tightened the original clamps then reconnected the water, drain and electrical connections and reinstalled the washer. All in about an hour, The only glitch was the grounding screw for the ground wire on the motor. The screw was too long to tighten.

Immediately ran the washer through a cycle, all worked perfectly.}', '{Installation Issue: The old pump for this 21 year old dishwasher was leaking.  Reviewing the cost of a new dishwasher at the big box stores convinced me replacing the part would be much less money., How to Repair: I had hoped to be able to do the entire replacement at the floor level through the front panel without moving the dishwasher out of the cabinet.  That turned out to be impossible because two of the machine screws holding in the old pump rusted and would not budge.     I did however manage to do the replacement by moving the dishwasher only 16 to 18"" out of the cabinet so that I could work on more than one side.  A word of advice:  Once the pump is disconnected get it out of the house as soon as possible.  It will continue to leak on your floor otherwise.   No point in getting your pants, shirt and tools all wet.     The best part of this replacement came when I buttoned the whole thing back-up and ran it.  This new pump was significantly less noisy than the old one making it possible to stay in the kitchen and actually have a conversation with someone.  (My dog no longer leaves either.)      Would I do it again....you bet!}', ""{Installation Issue: Dishwasher would not turn on., How to Repair: There are 2 switches that should be pressed in when you move the handle to lock door, the switches usually go bad with time.

I pulled off the plastic end caps to the top rack that allows the roller wheels to be pulled out of the aluminum rails.  You need to push in the raised edge of the plastic caps so they clear the rail slot in order to remove them.  This takes a little bit of finger pressure or you can use a flat-edge screw driver to pop them out.  2. Once this procedure is completed, you simply remove the rack and rollers from both rails and remove the old roller wheels and replace them with the new ones.  3. I used a phillips-head screw driver to tighten up the rail wheels before re-installing the top rack into the rails and then re-inserted the end caps.  Pliers are handy to help get the end caps back into the rail slots.  4. I finally used a silcon spray on all of the rolling parts of the top tray assembly for lubrication.}', '{Installation Issue: Dishwasher was leaking, How to Repair: Disconnected the electrical, water supply and drain.

I followed the instructions as indicated in the  ""HOW TO"" article on the website. I used a steel putty knife and pried the light switch out of its retaining hole.

If the bulb\'s filament seems intact, screw the bulb into a known working lamp and see if it lights.

For replacing the switch, I unplugged the unit, used a paint scraper and worked it under the switch bezel from the right side. A bit of moxie, and the switch came out. The replacement switch had a different spade contact spacing than the original. I used a pair of scissors to cut the rubber bridge between the two switch wire connectors so I could connect to the new switch. In the end, it turned out to be the bulb. NOTE: The Model TC18KL is _not_ listed! What I finally found that the number ""P7803211WL"" on the sticker is actually a manufacturing code.

Removed the Defrost Time Kit and inspected it for any damage and found none. Then I placed a flathead screwdriver to the manual advance knob and slightly rotate the gear mechanism.

I then pryed the socket out with a flat-head screwdriver.  I could tell that the socket was anchored in its hole with clips so it was relatively easy to pry it out.  Once the socket was out, I disconnected the lead wires and ordered a replacement socket kit from Partselect.  When the new one arrived, I reconnected the lead wires to it, snapped it back into its hole, screwed in a new  lightbulb, and presto!!  The light was back on with no further problem.

The panel is not held in place with screws, but can be gently pried off.5. Remove two screws from the back that hold the housing in place.6. Remove screws from the front that hold the housing in place.7. Drop housing down (still attached by wires - do not detach). Timer is inside housing, located on right.8. Follow the instructions provided to identify your particular wiring setup. You\'ll find the wiring diagram (on my model) at the bottom of the refrigerator, alongside the defrost catch pan, behind the airflow grille.9. Remove connector from timer terminals (4).10. Remove two screws/nuts that hold the timer in place.11. Install replacement timer following included directions. Read and follow ALL instructions applicable to your particular model and wiring setup.12. Reassemble by reversing the steps above.13. Note: You may need to ""jog"" the replacement timer when you  first plug the refrigerator back in, if the timer happens to be in a ""defrost cycle"" (the compressor won\'t start). This can be done by inserting a wide bladed screwdriver into the hole below the timer, aligning it with the timer shaft, and slightly turning the shaft CW.

And there was absolutely no water at all in the drip pan under the fridge.  So I took the doors off and totally took the inside of the freezer apart.  I discovered that the styrofoam on the floor of the freezer had become inudated with fluid and the under the foam the coils were all frozen solid with ice.  Hence not allowing any drainage. I put a lamp in the freezer area and defrosted all the ice.  In searching the internet i discovered that they no longer produce the foam so i went to home depot and got a piece of foam and aluminum foil and cut it to replace the ruined foam.

After removing the cardboard panel in back of the refrigerator I noticed the fan was not running when the rfigerator was. The fan was held in place by three brackets. I unscrewed the screws holding the fan motor to the brackets and also unscrewed one of the brackets to make room to pull the motor out. I cut the wires close to the motor.

The condenser fan was not turning and there was heat build up in the area causing the refrigerator to not work properly creating elevated temperatures in both the freezer and regrigerator. Removal of three torx screws from the original motor was all it took to get the motor free. By turining it and working the fan blade around the mounting bracket I had the motor out in just a few minutes.  Replacing the new motor was just as easy to reinstall.  The fan was removed from the old motor and placed on the new for installation. The original motor was wired to accept a connector from the wiring harness of the refrigerator.  I simply cut the connector off the wiring harness and stripped the insulation from the wires which easily allowed me to connet the wires of the motor and harness with two wire nuts. Three self tapping screws were used to hold the motor in place replacing the torx screws. Installed I plugged the unit in and immediately the fan started spinning as the unit came to life.

Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

When I tapped on the bottom of the timer it began functioning normally (for a few days).  Ordered a new Defrost Timer Kit and along with the installation instruction, I watched the on-line video. It was very helpful!! After installation was complete, I plugged the Refrigerator into the electrical outlet and.......nothing happened!    Hmmm! Removed the Defrost Time Kit and inspected it for any damage and found none. Then I placed a flathead screwdriver to the manual advance knob and slightly rotate the gear mechanism. I heard a distance ""click”.  I believe the Timer was in the ‘defrost’ mode when received. I reinstalled the timer, verified the wiring connections and this time plugged the Refrigerator into the electrical outlet and ….. it worked!!!I unplugged the refrigerator, finished the installation per the instructions, plugged the unit in and monitored it for a few hours (just in case).

I then pryed the socket out with a flat-head screwdriver.  I could tell that the socket was anchored in its hole with clips so it was relatively easy to pry it out.  Once the socket was out, I disconnected the lead wires and ordered a replacement socket kit from Partselect.  When the new one arrived, I reconnected the lead wires to it, snapped it back into its hole, screwed in a new  lightbulb, and presto!!  The light was back on with no further problem.

And there was absolutely no water at all in the drip pan under the fridge.  So I took the doors off and totally took the inside of the freezer apart.  I discovered that the styrofoam on the floor of the freezer had become inudated with fluid and the under the foam the coils were all frozen solid with ice.  Hence not allowing any drainage. I put a lamp in the freezer area and defrosted all the ice.

I unscrewed the screws holding the fan motor to the brackets and also unscrewed one of the brackets to make room to pull the motor out. I cut the wires close to the motor.

The first time it was installed, the fridge did not come on and the temperature rose after a couple hours. Looked at the part and realized the defrost cycle must have kicked in. Needed to slightly turn the gray slotted part to initiate the timer so it would stop the defrost and start the fridge. That did it! It must have advanced the timer so it could accumulate run time.  Whole repair saved us $3000 in a new fridge.}', ""{Installation Issue: The door light socket was broken and hanging down, How to Repair: The refrigerator light in our Kenmore fridge has been flaky for a number of years. The slightest bump would knock it out of the hole it fits into leaving the bulb dangling. Usually since we were used to it, we could avoid bumping it so it was no real problem, but a recent visitor bumped it and it once again was hanging. I decided this time, to take a serious look at it and fix the problem for real. I had options, duct tape, hot glue gun, goop...or a new part! A quick search on the internet, and I found www.PartSelect.com I entered my model # , quickly found the correct part number. The part came 1 1/2 days after I ordered it.  The repair was very simple, I unplugged the fridge, removed the wires from the spade connectors on the old light socket, and attached them to the new socket. I then pushed the socket into the hole, and with new spring clips, it snapped snuggly into place. The socket came with extra wire connectors which I didn't need, the socket fits multiple brands of appliances. It also came with a bulb protector, but that wasn't needed for my fridge either.  I was very pleased with the speed and ease of the repair.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.  Lastly I replaced the upper tubular light bulb and the lower light socket I purchased here and installed a 40 watt bulb in the new light socket.  Presto!  I was able to turn non working abandoned refrigerator into a workable unit.}', '{Installation Issue: Raplaced switch, How to Repair: Repair went well,took about five to ten minutes to disconnect the power from the fridge removed the defective switch installed the new one ,reconnected the power,,,and Let there be light and there was light!}', '{Installation Issue: Broken filler tube at threaded connection, How to Repair: After discovering that the water noise was coming from the rear of the refridgerator upon pulling it foward I discivered the connection line had broken.

The power wires can be connected to either terminal however, and I suppose you could leave it as is if your wires can reach. Turning it will make the knob off 90 deg. off from original markings (off to coldest) but I simply remarked the position with a marker.  (make sure you connect all terminals before mounting the bracket, it\'s much easier that way.                                                                                   .Note: this was a 40+ year old Sears ""Coldspot"" refridg. and it works like a dream since I changed out this original cold control.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.

The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

The condenser fan was not turning and there was heat build up in the area causing the refrigerator to not work properly creating elevated temperatures in both the freezer and regrigerator. Removal of three torx screws from the original motor was all it took to get the motor free. By turining it and working the fan blade around the mounting bracket I had the motor out in just a few minutes.  Replacing the new motor was just as easy to reinstall.  The fan was removed from the old motor and placed on the new for installation. The original motor was wired to accept a connector from the wiring harness of the refrigerator.  I simply cut the connector off the wiring harness and stripped the insulation from the wires which easily allowed me to connet the wires of the motor and harness with two wire nuts. Three self tapping screws were used to hold the motor in place replacing the torx screws. Installed I plugged the unit in and immediately the fan started spinning as the unit came to life.

Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

Once the socket was out, I disconnected the lead wires and ordered a replacement socket kit from Partselect.  When the new one arrived, I reconnected the lead wires to it, snapped it back into its hole, screwed in a new  lightbulb, and presto!!  The light was back on with no further problem.

And there was absolutely no water at all in the drip pan under the fridge.  So I took the doors off and totally took the inside of the freezer apart.  I discovered that the styrofoam on the floor of the freezer had become inudated with fluid and the under the foam the coils were all frozen solid with ice.  Hence not allowing any drainage. I put a lamp in the freezer area and defrosted all the ice.

I unscrewed the screws holding the fan motor to the brackets and also unscrewed one of the brackets to make room to pull the motor out. I cut the wires close to the motor.

The first time it was installed, the fridge did not come on and the temperature rose after a couple hours. Looked at the part and realized the defrost cycle must have kicked in. Needed to slightly turn the gray slotted part to initiate the timer so it would stop the defrost and start the fridge. That did it! It must have advanced the timer so it could accumulate run time.  Whole repair saved us $3000 in a new fridge.}', ""{Installation Issue: The door light socket was broken and hanging down, How to Repair: The refrigerator light in our Kenmore fridge has been flaky for a number of years. The slightest bump would knock it out of the hole it fits into leaving the bulb dangling. Usually since we were used to it, we could avoid bumping it so it was no real problem, but a recent visitor bumped it and it once again was hanging. I decided this time, to take a serious look at it and fix the problem for real. I had options, duct tape, hot glue gun, goop...or a new part! A quick search on the internet, and I found www.PartSelect.com I entered my model # , quickly found the correct part number. The part came 1 1/2 days after I ordered it.  The repair was very simple, I unplugged the fridge, removed the wires from the spade connectors on the old light socket, and attached them to the new socket. I then pushed the socket into the hole, and with new spring clips, it snapped snuggly into place. The socket came with extra wire connectors which I didn't need, the socket fits multiple brands of appliances. It also came with a bulb protector, but that wasn't needed for my fridge either.  I was very pleased with the speed and ease of the repair.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.  Lastly I replaced the upper tubular light bulb and the lower light socket I purchased here and installed a 40 watt bulb in the new light socket.  Presto!  I was able to turn non working abandoned refrigerator into a workable unit.}', '{Installation Issue: Raplaced switch, How to Repair: Repair went well,took about five to ten minutes to disconnect the power from the fridge removed the defective switch installed the new one ,reconnected the power,,,and Let there be light and there was light!}', '{Installation Issue: Broken filler tube at threaded connection, How to Repair: After discovering that the water noise was coming from the rear of the refridgerator upon pulling it foward I discivered the connection line had broken.

The power wires can be connected to either terminal however, and I suppose you could leave it as is if your wires can reach. Turning it will make the knob off 90 deg. off from original markings (off to coldest) but I simply remarked the position with a marker.  (make sure you connect all terminals before mounting the bracket, it\'s much easier that way.                                                                                   .Note: this was a 40+ year old Sears ""Coldspot"" refridg. and it works like a dream since I changed out this original cold control.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.

The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

The condenser fan was not turning and there was heat build up in the area causing the refrigerator to not work properly creating elevated temperatures in both the freezer and regrigerator. Removal of three torx screws from the original motor was all it took to get the motor free. By turining it and working the fan blade around the mounting bracket I had the motor out in just a few minutes.  Replacing the new motor was just as easy to reinstall.  The fan was removed from the old motor and placed on the new for installation. The original motor was wired to accept a connector from the wiring harness of the refrigerator.  I simply cut the connector off the wiring harness and stripped the insulation from the wires which easily allowed me to connet the wires of the motor and harness with two wire nuts. Three self tapping screws were used to hold the motor in place replacing the torx screws. Installed I plugged the unit in and immediately the fan started spinning as the unit came to life.

The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

The blade looked fine, but I ordered a grommet anyway to ensure that there was no vibration problems causing the fan motor to go out.  When the fan motor arrived, I began disconnecting the old one after unpluging the refridgerator and noting the terminals for the wires.  The wire terminals were in a slightly different location, but reasoned out which wire belonged to the correct location.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

Do to the fact that Whirlpool has the part stick out on the back top part of the fridge.

I unscrewed the two screws that held the old broken part to the fridge.3.\tI opened the freezer section and cleared out the top shelf till I could see the back of the fridge. 4.\tI removed the old plastic part by pushing & wiggling it about forward and it then extended out the back of the freezer side and then I pulled it out the back and it came out.5.\tI slid the new replacement part in basically the reverse of step 4.6.\tI connected the hose in the back.  To the new, replacement plastic part, that fills the automatic ice tray with water.7.\tOnce finished I glued a small 2”x2” piece of wood next to the new part so the fridge will never get too close to the back wall so to never break that part that sticks out again.  Before just a small bump could break the part and water is everywhere and this leak could happen slowly at first and the next day what a mess.Some fridges have this part recessed into the back of the fridge so this would never happen as my other fridge has.Also, this might seem like more work then it was. It was very simple.  I was scared I'd screw it up, but just did it step by step.  If I had someone do it.  It would have cost me a bundle.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.

The repair was very simple, I unplugged the fridge, removed the wires from the spade connectors on the old light socket, and attached them to the new socket. I then pushed the socket into the hole, and with new spring clips, it snapped snuggly into place.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.  Lastly I replaced the upper tubular light bulb and the lower light socket I purchased here and installed a 40 watt bulb in the new light socket.  Presto!  I was able to turn non working abandoned refrigerator into a workable unit.}', ""{Installation Issue: Filler tube broken and old tube frozen over, How to Repair: this is a snap! 2 screws an a nut to tighten and it works like a charm. the filler tube in my Kenmore refer had broken off in the back.

I inserted the new evaporator tray carefully into position.  The tricky part was starting the nut that secures the pan because of the confined space that I had to work in.

The slightest bump would knock it out of the hole it fits into leaving the bulb dangling. Usually since we were used to it, we could avoid bumping it so it was no real problem, but a recent visitor bumped it and it once again was hanging. I decided this time, to take a serious look at it and fix the problem for real. I had options, duct tape, hot glue gun, goop...or a new part! A quick search on the internet, and I found www.PartSelect.com I entered my model # , quickly found the correct part number. The part came 1 1/2 days after I ordered it.  The repair was very simple, I unplugged the fridge, removed the wires from the spade connectors on the old light socket, and attached them to the new socket. I then pushed the socket into the hole, and with new spring clips, it snapped snuggly into place. The socket came with extra wire connectors which I didn't need, the socket fits multiple brands of appliances. It also came with a bulb protector, but that wasn't needed for my fridge either.  I was very pleased with the speed and ease of the repair.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.  Lastly I replaced the upper tubular light bulb and the lower light socket I purchased here and installed a 40 watt bulb in the new light socket.  Presto!

The slightest bump would knock it out of the hole it fits into leaving the bulb dangling. Usually since we were used to it, we could avoid bumping it so it was no real problem, but a recent visitor bumped it and it once again was hanging. I decided this time, to take a serious look at it and fix the problem for real. I had options, duct tape, hot glue gun, goop...or a new part! A quick search on the internet, and I found www.PartSelect.com I entered my model # , quickly found the correct part number. The part came 1 1/2 days after I ordered it.  The repair was very simple, I unplugged the fridge, removed the wires from the spade connectors on the old light socket, and attached them to the new socket. I then pushed the socket into the hole, and with new spring clips, it snapped snuggly into place. The socket came with extra wire connectors which I didn't need, the socket fits multiple brands of appliances. It also came with a bulb protector, but that wasn't needed for my fridge either.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.  Lastly I replaced the upper tubular light bulb and the lower light socket I purchased here and installed a 40 watt bulb in the new light socket.  Presto!

The slightest bump would knock it out of the hole it fits into leaving the bulb dangling. Usually since we were used to it, we could avoid bumping it so it was no real problem, but a recent visitor bumped it and it once again was hanging. I decided this time, to take a serious look at it and fix the problem for real. I had options, duct tape, hot glue gun, goop...or a new part! A quick search on the internet, and I found www.PartSelect.com I entered my model # , quickly found the correct part number. The part came 1 1/2 days after I ordered it.  The repair was very simple, I unplugged the fridge, removed the wires from the spade connectors on the old light socket, and attached them to the new socket. I then pushed the socket into the hole, and with new spring clips, it snapped snuggly into place. The socket came with extra wire connectors which I didn't need, the socket fits multiple brands of appliances. It also came with a bulb protector, but that wasn't needed for my fridge either.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.  Lastly I replaced the upper tubular light bulb and the lower light socket I purchased here and installed a 40 watt bulb in the new light socket.  Presto!

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Lights inside refrigerator not working, How to Repair: I used a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the old light rocker switch.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Lights inside refrigerator not working, How to Repair: I used a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the old light rocker switch.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Lights inside refrigerator not working, How to Repair: I used a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the old light rocker switch.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Lights inside refrigerator not working, How to Repair: I used a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the old light rocker switch.

The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Lights inside refrigerator not working, How to Repair: I used a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the old light rocker switch.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Lights inside refrigerator not working, How to Repair: I used a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the old light rocker switch.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.

The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.}"", ""{Installation Issue: Lights inside refrigerator not working, How to Repair: I used a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the old light rocker switch.

Usually since we were used to it, we could avoid bumping it so it was no real problem, but a recent visitor bumped it and it once again was hanging. I decided this time, to take a serious look at it and fix the problem for real. I had options, duct tape, hot glue gun, goop...or a new part! A quick search on the internet, and I found www.PartSelect.com I entered my model # , quickly found the correct part number. The part came 1 1/2 days after I ordered it.  The repair was very simple, I unplugged the fridge, removed the wires from the spade connectors on the old light socket, and attached them to the new socket. I then pushed the socket into the hole, and with new spring clips, it snapped snuggly into place. The socket came with extra wire connectors which I didn't need, the socket fits multiple brands of appliances. It also came with a bulb protector, but that wasn't needed for my fridge either.  I was very pleased with the speed and ease of the repair. No more dangling light bulbs!}"", '{Installation Issue: Refrigerator light would not stay on, How to Repair: Removed the 2 screws holding the light bulb shield, then the 4 uolding the metal panel.

(1) Disconnect the power, (2) Roll the appliance out so you can get to the back, (3) Using a nut driver remove all the screws from the lower back panel then remove the panel, (4) Remove the tensioner wire, (5) unplug the electrical connection to the capacitor, (6) gently but firmly remove the capacitor and starter relay as one unit, (7) preassemble your new capacitor and starter relay as one unit, (8) now simply reverse your steps for installing and you are done!

I then went to You Tube to watch how to replace the part but most importantly to find out where it was located and degree of difficulty. Replacement was rather simple and it fixed our 22 year old fridge. I must add that when I looked up the part it also told you what percent of the time that particular item actually fixed the problem based on others experience. I thought that was neat info. as I felt better about ordering something that may or may not fix my problem.

The freezer door would not close properly because someone had previously removed the lower door support bracket and failed to replace the lower bracket shim that positions the lower part of the freezer door properly out from the refrigerator cabinet causing the door gasket seal to bind before the freezer door was fully closed.  I removed and replaced this lower door bracket with a new shim made up of serveral thicknesses of cardboard to achieve this spacing and freezer door now closes and seals properly.  They had never connected a water supply to the refrigerator although this model is equiped with an ice maker and in door ice and cold water dispenser.  The access panel on the back of the unit had been previously removed and discarded.  I made up a new access panel from cardboard and connected the water line to the solenoid valve.  Valve was so old it would barely open when valve energized and water flow was too slow to make proper sized ice cubes and fill a water glass.  I purchased a new water solenoid valve and replaced ther original valve and cured that problem.  Replacing the access panel cured an improper cooling problem because with panel removed, most of the air flow bypasses the condenser coils.  Lastly I replaced the upper tubular light bulb and the lower light socket I purchased here and installed a 40 watt bulb in the new light socket.  Presto!  I was able to turn non working abandoned refrigerator into a workable unit.}', '{Installation Issue: Raplaced switch, How to Repair: Repair went well,took about five to ten minutes to disconnect the power from the fridge removed the defective switch installed the new one ,reconnected the power,,,and Let there be light and there was light!}', '{Installation Issue: lights wouldn\'t come on/work in refrigerator, How to Repair: Referencing the info/schematics you have on your website, I unscrewed/unattached top-front panel (carefully), from behind the panel you have to detach the wires (2) from the switch, pushed ""in"" the switch to remove, put in new switch and attach wires to test BEFORE remounting panel.

Everything I needed was in the kit.  The refrigerator was presetup for an icemaker it was just never added.

You-tubed videos on how to replace these.  Looked easy.  Just unplug them from the condenser and replace.  Contacted Part Select and staff said 50% of the the time it was the capacitor, 50% of the time it was the relay. I was in a time crunch so I ordered both and they came in a couple of days.  I replaced the capacitor but the clicking noise continued.  I replaced the relay and problem solved! Maybe I could have gotten away with just replacing the relay, but I had them both by then and figured with a 10 year old fridge, better replace them both at the same time and be done with the problem.  So far, so good.}', '{Installation Issue: Clicking & popping for about 30 sec. when compressor starts, How to Repair: As shown on the YouTube link sent with email receipt.Removed back panel.
